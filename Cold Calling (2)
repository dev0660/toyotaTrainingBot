call me I'm a previous customer ready ready I swear on my life we're going to dial a customer in a minute and I will shut them down on the first call let's call a customer beon all I need is 2 minutes I won't waste your time being Savage my life is a little graphic like HBO making magic I'm rapping to make that passive money coming from traffic doal gymnastics an outbound call my man who says he has time block problems right that he needs to make a 100 phone calls a day or sell one car what does that mean that means if he's working from 9 to 5 either hits 100 dials or sells one car now does he got to sell someone a car off the phone no he can sell him a car off the lot but he's got to hit a 100 dials does that make sense okay so remember this I I said this to you guys earlier I said everybody has 150 hours a month that they're not doing anything with so where are we going to put that 150 hours making outbound calls which are I call cold calls now we can call two people we can call leads that have came in who didn't buy or we could call people who bought here before right you guys had a lot of people buy here before right yes okay call me I'm a previous customer ready ready all right ring ring hello hey Andy it's Kevin from suburb Jr how you doing today good what's going on buddy I just wanted to check in with you I know we bought the Jeep Grand Cherokee about 2 months ago seeing how that's doing everybody listen to me what do you guys do for a living no you don't Rel you got you do build relationships yeah you do sell cars but you got to speak for a living self-mastery get your mind right take care of all that what comes after that speaking do you guys love where you work yes or no hope do you guys okay is your job to get people to say yes or no he didn't frame the language to get me to say yes your job is to be a master Communicator make it easy to say yes to hard to say no to and make it the client's idea every single time you want me to show you yes okay ring ring answer hey this is Kevin hey what's going on Kevin it's Andy down here at ABC Chevy where you bought your last car from listen I was reviewing your account I need about 30 seconds of your time it's extremely important can I get 30 seconds go for it he said yes awesome hey do you still have the 2019 uh Chev Chevrolet you bought from us back in 2020 you still got it oh yeah just okay beautiful well the reason why I was reaching out is cuz my general manager danne over here he wanted me to ask you if you still had it and if you did he wanted me to ask you a second question if he was willing to offer you more money more money than what your car was worth would you mind if I told you how much that was could I tell you yeah did he say no to any of this can I make him say yes now I'll say all right cool let me tell you how this works basically my general manager you know we we've rode over $200,000 in checks for vehicles over the last 30 days overpaying for people's cars he's getting so crazy we're about to put them in a straight jacket all I need you to do is come down to the store it's going to take about 30 seconds I'm going to give you a crazy offer blow your mind and in the end it's your decision does that sound fair oh yeah this is easy this is all day long I'm just dialing I'm getting people in when I do that what is he thinking on the way in man I wonder if I sell what am I going to buy hey I wonder what they're going to give me is he thinking about buying a car is he thinking about doing something yeah because if he said no he wouldn't he wouldn't come in but I got him to say yes this is Andy down at ABC where you bought your last car from I'm reviewing your account I need 30 seconds of your time it's extremely important can I get 30 seconds I hooked him do you guys hear me okay if you guys want to be great at anything you got to hook people people you got to get them interested in what you're talking about when you call someone and they're doing something else don't you got to get them interested do you want to learn how to be a great salesperson yes okay what if I teach it to you and you won't learn it La okay do you guys want to learn this yes if you listen to me I just figure from now till the end of time until I leave I've told you guys self-mastery is number one to change and if you don't change nothing changes let me teach you guys how to make an outbound call is that cool yes love it if you guys will memorize this right now and you'll get good at it I promise you when I leave you guys will all set 10 or 20 appointments every day is that cool okay have a seat let's let's train every class has been different this one I'm going to train all right write this down you ready I need a new piece of paper let let's go to a new a new spot okay so so yeah yeah let's let's make sure you have room to write Okay so customer answers they say hello and you say hi write it down so a lot of people ask me hey Jacqueline how do you manage being in business being a mom being a wife and also handling a team and everything in life well now we have all the answers I started a show that will be on my YouTube channel now it's going to be on Jacqueline Elliot is a YouTube channel and I'm going to be releasing beginning on January 15th a podcast every week so if you're curious about who is behind Andy Elliot in the Elliott group check it out see you there this is and write your name what's your name Ryan Ryan okay hi this is Ryan with okay everybody ready we're going to memorize it did you write it down okay cool the next thing you say is I was reviewing your account I was reviewing your account what is your account I got your name and phone number we're good it doesn't matter there's no account but that gets them interested like what account okay I need 30 seconds of your time so write this down I was reviewing your account I need 30 seconds of your time it's extremely important okay everybody got that rote okay everybody this is called a quick pop so it's like this I say something I say something I say something and then I don't give him a chance to think and I just pop him with something real quick does that make sense and I say can I get 30 seconds write that down this is where you you you you wrap up the sentence with can I get 30 seconds and it's like a question it's like a question mark like explanation point okay so this hey what hi this is Ryan down here at cdjr and Arbor I was reviewing your account need 30 seconds of your time it's extremely important is tonality important yes yes you got to have tonality so if it was a real life phone call right here and I could call any customer and close them in front of you I swear on my life we're going to dial a customer in a minute and I will shut them down on the first call I don't care who they are what's going on it's Andy down here at ABC Motors where you bought your last car from listen I was reviewing your account I need about 30 seconds of your time it's extremely important can I get 30 seconds they always say uh yeah that's all you need there's the first yes does that make sense okay and I want you to write this down awesome I got two quick questions just say awesome I got two quick questions and then you say question number one you're going to label the question do you still have the X Y and Z car that you purchase from us very simple do you still have it 99% of the time they're going to say yes if they say no say oh no well what do you got now and then they're like well I got a 2018 Dodge Ram oh tell me about it okay cool why how long have you had it okay awesome so that's the vehicle you have now awesome so my second question and you just move right in cuz you're going to ask a question on that car instead of that car does that make sense so question number one do you still have the X Y and Z car and they're most likely going to say yes if not just deviate and say what do you got okay once they say yes question number two my general manager wanted me to personally reach out and ask you if you still had that vehicle and if you did wanted me to ask you and by the way I could say question number two I could say he wanted me to ask you the second question does that make sense it's like I wouldn't ask that's why you're asking the second question so right it's kind of formatted like this what's going on this is Andy down here at ABC Motors where you bought your last car from I was reviewing your account need 30 seconds of your time is extremely important can I get 30 seconds sure okay awesome question number one it's got two quick questions question number one do you still have the X Y and Z car you bought from us previously yes I do beautiful well since you have the vehicle the second question my general manager personally wanted me to ask you you got to say general manager personally wanted me to ask you that's the most important thing okay is that if he was willing to offer you since you have it if he was willing to offer you my general manager if he was willing to offer you remember the if is so important if he was willing to offer you and I I want you to write this very carefully word for word what I'm about to say next if he was willing to offer you more money and listen I want you to do me a favor put a dot dot dot which means there's a pause and then I want you to say more money you say it twice it it still feels it in their brain he wants to know if we were willing to offer you more money more money than what your car was worth would you mind if we told you how much that was my general manager wanted to personally reach out and ask you if he was one to offer you more money dot dot dot pause more money it's like we're popping them in the mouth with it then what your car was worth would you mind if I told you how much that was would would you mind if I told you how much that was okay and then and then put dot dot dot and say can I tell you and they're always like yeah you can tell me see you're just you're you're you're bringing them along this is this is called make it easy to say yes to hard to say no to and make it the client's idea by the way remember this I sold 70 to 80 cars a month when I sold cars so if anybody wants to know how to sell more cars I'm telling you if anybody's like oh I don't I don't want to listen it's like I don't know what to do keep selling eight cars but I'm telling you how to sell 50 cars a month I'm telling you right now and you can all do it I am I am a trained assassin I got trained by somebody I memorized everything my mentor told me I knew my stuff my mentor stuff better than he knew it that's how serious I was about making money and changing my life and you're going to have to be the same way so here's the play We're going to run if you guys get a customer on the lot okay on the lot or the phone I know naturally you're going to try to sell it I know that right the money you're making now is is this am I right everybody now there's a new category of money and this is called cold call okay now I'm going to show you what to say when they're on the phone to get them in and I'm going to show you what to say also to get them in and also what to say when they get here to get them to buy something is that cool and we're going to finish this day with you guys knowing what to do to pick up this money now everybody's like time management do you see people on the phone dial on the phones all day long no we are now you can call anybody you want and say this you can call anyone and you can just ask them hey it's Andy down here at ABC Motors you inquired about a vehicle in the past hey my general manager wanted me to reach out for 30 seconds and ask what vehicle you're currently driving I'm driving this car okay awesome well let me ask you a question my general manager was willing to offer you more money more money than what that car was worth would you mind would you mind if he told you how much that was could we tell you yeah dude you call anybody it doesn't have to be previous customers it could be someone who inquired on a lead it's the same language I could walk out to the service drive you guys got service customers it's Andy Elliott what's your name Mike Mike nice to meet you you got your car in service yes sir nice man well awesome I appreciate you doing you know doing business with us here hey what can I get you to drink something hard or while you're waiting on your vehicle I got something thank you let me get you something man if you come to my house I got to feed you I'm going to get you something something hot something cold I'll get you an empty cup I got to get you something Mike what do you want I'll take a water see I'm gonna get his to take something you know why cuz he's about to sit down with me do you guys understand that everybody get that reciprocity if I give something to Mike Mike's got to give something back to me I'm going to make Mike take something I will go get an empty Styrofoam cup and go here I wasn't playing I'm going to get you something okay now everybody pay attention if I walk out to service and I go meet Mike then I'm going to say hey Mike what do you have he's like I got a 28 to a Cora 30,000 mies awesome did you buy it from us did you buy it somewhere else how long have you had it well listen my general manager right now they're trying to buy as many economy Vehicles as they can let me ask you a question why you got in the service Drive hypothetically if he was willing to offer you more money more money than what your car was worth while you're sitting in service today would you mind if we told you how much that was could we tell you yeah no problem it's like oh okay hey hypothetically Mike let's say he offered you more money than what it was worth what would you replace it with something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage what would it be I would want something the same hey like newer yes lower miles yeah okay kind of like the same Toyota same style body or does it got to be a Toyota again it'll be the same card Mike do you got a magic rabbit foot in your pocket buddy because it's your lucky day I got something Mike come here come out of service with me now Mike's walking out on the lot with with me does that make sense does anybody know what persuade means what does it mean you're trying to get them to say yes to something that you want to do to persuade is to influence someone it's what leaders do you know why you all have to be leaders in here because I know who the leader is and I know who the leader isn't when you become the leader I want to follow the leader do you think customers want to follow the leader damn right they do they pull up on the lot and they know who isn't the leader they know who the leader you know how I knew that was that the guy runs the store yeah was H in the corner how did I know he was the guy that ran the store cuz he was talking his presence no because you can see it in his eyes I could see it in his eyes when I walked in I don't know who anybody is I walked in I go hey do you run you you you run the store don't you and he goes yeah and I said okay makes sense because your eyes tell me you run the store I know who runs the show I wish when people would pull up here or when you would make a call you got sound like you ran the show by the way that's not arrogant that's not being an [ __ ] it's not cocky it's confidence baby dude people love confident people people want to do business with confident people and not arrogant people some people carry this freaking look on their face like I don't give a [ __ ] and I don't like that like it's all about me it's not about you I

wanted me to ask you one question if he was willing to offer you more money more money than what your car was worth would you mind if he told you how much that was could I tell you okay now do it again and if you did if you was willing to offer more money more money and what your vehicle is worth would you mind if I told you what that number was okay you need some tonality buddy and you need a

with excited you're excited to do this you're excited to earn more money yeah sure it may feel weird that means I'm excited to do it like dude I want to get this down so I can go make some more money

not the king okay I'm not I'm not saying I'm the top one I was the top 1% in the Auto industry I'm I'm saying I was the best I'm saying that how I got the results I got was because systematically I knew what I was going to say so most people pick up the phone and they don't know what the outcome's going to be but I know what the outcome is going to be I can make you say what I want you to say and I can make anybody do it now I'm not saying you're not going to get somebody sometimes that's like oh yeah I don't want to know I love my car thank you I'm in a hurry I'm with my kids in the car

taking candy from a baby it feels exciting to win what did I say well no but I said run the play am I right run the play so here's what we got we got everybody counting all their money here on the lot but nobody's dialing on the phone and all these people listen he's like well I checked back last year dude you checked last year dude cars are 20 grand over sticker no wonder he didn't buy something last year dude if this guy bought a car in 2021 listen to me in 2021 he probably got a good deal they probably had rebates on it right now that car is probably worth good money he's not upside down on it your manager would love to take it in for a tradein he's probably dying to get a 2021 Cherokee the guy obviously now is going to need what step two which is where we're going to ask him when he comes in all right my general manager is going to check it out he's obviously going to blow you away but I have a question okay let's say that we made you a crazy the offer and you're like and I and by the way can you guys play with me I say it goes like this so let's act like I'm with her okay and I'm like Okay cool so so all right so here's the point right now obviously if my general manager comes in here in a minute he's goingon to make you a crazy offer and you're going to be like you know what get your checkbook out because I'm selling it I'm sure that's going to happen when you do what are you going to replace it with is it going to be something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage what would it be that that next thing they say is the car we're going to sell them dude I swear if you guys will listen to me I'll will make you more money then you know what to do with the the market is dying to pay all of you but you must be skilled and you must be believe you must believe and guys you got to understand what training is about training is exciting dude when you train with people and and I just want to tell you guys something like that have never succeeded or done anything like I get it I wouldn't believe it either if God was telling me how to sell stocks and he Ain never sold stocks before like I wouldn't want or or he was a sh stock salesman but if I was talking to a person that made hundreds of millions of dollars on the wall on Wall Street with stocks I'm like dude teach me everything you know and when they tell me the play I'm just going to run it and by the way my goal is is that when I speak to you guys and I tell you you got to run the play you did a really good job on that call did you hear how the words matter right and did you notice he's like well can't you tell me on the phone and I was like getting in her face I'm like don't [ __ ] tell him no get his ass here go go go right like like you guys need to have me in your ear thinking like would Andy trip [ __ ] right now like if this guy was telling me no you and by the way I need you to know that when I sold I didn't have an Andy around me saying push through push through make the sell get it done I was like dude I don't eat if I don't get this deal come on man are you kidding me I'm going to blow you away man and that do you notice how she said if your house is worth 100 Grand I give you 500 Grand you wouldn't give me two minutes of your time I'm framing people where they can't say no they can't say no they can't they have to say yes now I must teach you the second part is that cool all right so somebody comes in write down when they come in when they come in and they're in the store okay first thing you do is you shake their hand and take them to a table okay when you take them to a table grab a grab an ACV card and grab the keys of their trade by the way everybody listen to me when you know you got an appointment and he's coming in tomorrow at 3:15 your goal is is that let your manager know you know like hey I got a guy coming in at 315 right you know I I hit him with if I could offer you more money it looks like he's got a good trade in you know we really need to try to trade for this when he gets here and try to figure out what to sell him you know like I want you I want you to know where this lead came from because I want you to help me sell it he's going to be like hell yeah dude we don't have to wait for UPS we'll take all the ups but plus we'll take these dude he wants that trade if you take that trade in you'll sell him a car and you'll sell that trade in 20 minutes so that's the goal we're going to create just a this this momentum uh um effect it's going to be nuts now so when you go get the ACV card and you go fill out all the information on the trade in I'm going to tell you what I would what I would recommend okay is get in the car and move it around to the side of the building do you hear me what does that mean get it away from where it was just my recommendation I'm not asking you to praise it I'm asking you to move it 30t on the side of the building we're not hiding it we're just moving it like oh I just moved it over here where my manager appraised this tradein does that make sense it's look yeah out of sight it's like dude they're sitting here and he's like oh I see my tradeing he's staring at it the whole time get it around to the side move it okay and and then you go to your manager and say hey this is my 315 appointment remember I was telling you about that guy here's here's the keys here's the card if you wouldn't mind checking it out I'm going to go have a talk with him now and I'm going to see what he would replace it with does does that make sense yeah we good okay you feel me you good you good we have them have a seat we pulled around on the side now what do we do when we walk back up to them everybody listen to me real quick when we walk back up to them we're going to sit down and I want you to say I got a quick question to ask you okay everybody write this down I got a quick question to ask you no no forget that scratch that sit back down and say all right hypothetically start out with this and I'm not saying you can't have small talk for a second but this is how you go into the pitch does that make sense the pitch is hypothetically write it down you got it hypothetically see if you don't write down what I'm telling you then they're going to get here and you're going to feel like an idiot because you're not going to say it right closers is say hypothetically even if you don't know how to spell it you know you know know what you're writing okay you know it says hypothetically in your language okay so hypothetically let's say my general manager comes back write this down hypothetically let's say my general manager comes back and makes you a crazy offer hypothetically let's say my general manager comes back makes you a crazy offer and you're like you're going to tell them your like and I want you to put your like and then put dot dot dot and you're like get your checkbook out cuz I'm selling it or I say like you and you tell me Andy get your checkbook out because I'm selling it you got to roleplay this and you're like or you say get your checkbook out because he's telling us like damn that's a lot of money so get your checkbook out because I'm selling it like he's decided to sell it like damn I'm selling it what would you drive home with what would you replace it with what would you drive home in what would you replace it with that's the question you ask so hypothetically let's say my general manager made you a crazy offer and you're like and I say and I point to them I go and you're like get your checkbook out because I'm selling it what would you drive home in you got that what would you drive home in hases everybody got that everybody got it okay what would you drive home in and now you multiple choice there you say what would you drive home in something newer and you got to take your hands you got to say something newer something bigger something smaller lower miles better gas mileage what would it be then shut your mouth whatever something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage more warranty what would it be and you just look at them like what would it be and they pick one because if you don't multiple choice them I'm going to tell you what what will happen you be like like well let's say my manager gives you all the money what would you want to buy and they're like damn I don't know and you're like well what do you think it would be now we're all screwed up we need him to make decisions we got to ask him questions multiple choice them you know let's say my general manager made you a crazy offer and you're like you know what get your checkbook out because I'm selling it and you need to practice this you guys need to roleplay this together okay you got this you know how to do this role playay this you got this down you teach everybody else this is easy okay what would you drive home with something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage more warranty what would it be just be quiet and they'll say probably something bigger bam when you say bigger do you mean like a bigger truck like a bigger SUV like higher off the ground like what do you thinking would you be bigger yeah like maybe higher off the ground cool like a small SUV little higher off the ground than what you got now okay cool you know what I got something for you why my manager's checking out your car I might
