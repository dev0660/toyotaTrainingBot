are you asking your prospects in the first 30 seconds of a conversation how are you doing today or how's your day going or how's the weather down there if so you're actually lowering your status in the prospect's brain and so today I'm going to show you what words not to use that lowers your status where they view you as just another salesperson trying to sell them something and I'm going to show you how to build real rapport with certain questions that get them to view you at a much higher status where they view you as more of expert are you ready come over here to this Vibe board and I'm going to show you what not to do and I'm going to show you what to do all right so have you been taught hey to build rapport on an inbound lead or an outbound lead or even a cold call and get into that conversation have you been taught to ask questions hey how's your day going over there or how are you doing today or how's the weather over there in Dallas or hey did you see the game last night and then you start talking about those type of things look I know you mean well and I know you've been trained that this is Rapport but I want you to think put yourself in your prospect shoes for a second how do most of your prospects view these type of questions that every salesperson who's ever tried to sell them ask what type of questions the same questions you are oh that might not be good for you here's how most prospects view those type of what I call fake Rapport questions here's how they view it I'm just trying to get you to like me so I can sell you my stuff that's how most prospects interpret those type of questions that I'm just trying to get you to like me so I can sell you my product my service my thing now why is that because I want you to think about how many how many salespeople that have ever tried to sell them anything from a vacuum cleaner to a car to a life insurance policy to maybe cyber security to their company ask what predictable questions at the beginning of a conversation the same ones that you are asking and if the prospect views you like they view all other salespeople and how does society view salespeople and large at a lower status so when you're asking the same questions that every salesperson uses they are literally viewing you as just another salesperson trying to sell them something so they're automatically starting to put you in a category that you probably don't want to be in now look I get it I know you meanwhile I've even had a few people come up to me after a keynote and there'll be a guy you know in a room of 5,000 people they'll be like but Jeremy you don't understand I really care about how my Prospect days are going and I'm like well are you really genuinely interested in how every single prospect's day going that you're talking to let's be real even if you are guess what your prospects don't think you are because they're used to everybody saying the same questions now I'm not talking about laydown sales I'm talking about most of your prospects all right so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you how to build real Rapport now what do I mean by real Rapport I mean real Rapport getting the prospect automatically into what we call results based thinking from the very first words are the very first questions out of your mouth are you ready you might want to write these down now I'm going to give you some generic examples first so you can plug in your industry and then I'm going to give you about five maybe six different industry specific examples from various industries that you can see how that format looks like you ready to do it let's go got cotton mouth in here today all right so how do we get the prospect into results based thinking from the first words out of her mouth okay why do we want to do that because when we build rapport we want them to view US automatically as more of an expert more of an authority a trusted Authority rather than just like all the other salespeople we want to build our status in the prospect's mind not lower our status we use the same words we ask the same questions that every salesperson ask we are lowering our status because Society of used salespeople at a lowered status we have to raise our status okay all right let me give you some examples okay in this example let's say this is a generic example like I mentioned write this down and let's say this is an inbound lead I'll show you some differences between inbound leads people who book on your calendar compared to you visi them on site maybe you're selling at their home or an office it's going to be a little bit of a tweak compared to maybe you're selling virtually on Zoom this first example I'll show you zoom so when you get on Zoom you don't want to start off like hey how's it going how you doing where do you live oh you're in Dallas I love Dallas did you watch the Cowboys game last night oh you watch the Cowboys game most prospects automatically starting to lower your status to see what you're doing and you sound like everybody else so when you get on Zoom it's the same foremost can you hear me yeah I can hear you can can you can you see me yeah I can see it now good way I would say you this is a whole another training if you want them to turn on their video let's say they don't have the video on you can lean in like you act confused confused to I'm like I'm is your video maybe broken I I can't see is your video broken or and a lot of times like oh sorry and they'll just turn on their video that's a whole another training but anyways so you get into there can you hear me yeah I can hear you oh hey can you see okay okay good and then what you're going to do is you're going to look it down at your notes okay because they can see you right you're virtual a little bit different if you're on the phone compared to to in the house or in the office I'll show you some tweaks there all right so then you're going to look down to your notes you're be like and you're going to slow down your tone don't say this fast you give them no time to internalize what you're asking you get to slow down your voice slow down the question and you're going to look down okay so it looks like you have booked on the calendar about looking at getting possible help with blank so that you guys could blank right okay so it looks like you had uh booked on the calendar about looking at possible about getting possible help with your blank so that you guys could blank right now what am I doing there I'm repeating back the end result of what you sell okay think about that for a second what is the end result of what you sell okay getting help with what so that you can repeat back what the end result of what you do is that's going to vary from industry industry I will show you different industry specific examples so you can get a concept and then write in yours okay so that you can blank right and you're going to say right at the end now the prospect always like yeah right now this what this does is it automatically gets them into results based thinking okay this is very key for you because we want to get them out of cost or or price based thinking into results based thinking all right let me show you some examples so you can see how it works okay in this example let's say if you sold B2B I'll show you some b2c B2B examples and let's say that you sold business Consulting you sell for a company that comes in and helps let's say SB types of company puts in put in better systems maybe better operations to really help Scale company so they can generate more Revenue they can grow the business so look at this so I'm going to do the same thing can you hear me yes I can hear now slow that down don't say can you hear me can you see me sounds awkward c can you hear me okay okay George and can you can you see me your video I don't think your video's working I can't see you oh okay all right okay so it looks like I'm going to look at my notes looks like you had booked on the calendar about looking at possible about getting possible help with putting in maybe better system so that you guys can scale the business right okay so it looks like you had booked on the calendar about looking at possible about getting possible help with putting in better uh systems better operations so you can grow the business right now what did I do there I'm saying there right now what is the end result if I'm selling business Consulting to SMB type of companies look at here I'm going to explain this why would I use possible why wouldn't I be more assumptive there I'm going to show you why but what is if I'm selling business Consulting what's the end result better systems so that they can scale what's the end result of selling business Consulting to smaller companies so they can scale the business that is the end result see when I get in them into the end result results based thinking they will start to view you more as an expert now there's a lot more to this after this you can't just ask one question like this and like this is an expert this is an authority there's a lot more after this but I'm showing you the start of that okay now why would I use the words possibly on the calendar about looking at possible about getting possible help with your blank why not say you had booked on the calendar to get help with better systems because if I do that especially if it's with an aype personality some aype personalities which a lot of business owners are are going to say well I I'm not ready to do anything I'm just kind of seeing what my options are if I assume this about getting help with putting in better system so you can scale right a lot of a types not all we'll be like well I didn't say I'm ready to buy today I'm just kind of looking at the options but if I just put the word about Poss about getting possible help that is a neutral word so I neutralize any type of sales pressure in that conversation that first question that would trigger sales resistance in their brain just a way to do that I'm neutralizing that word see the end result remember better systems so they can scale the business and then I say right at the end they're like yeah right okay let me show you few few more examples all right all right let's say if you sold solar you know business Consulting we huge industry R train solar massive industry we train it's probably the I want to say one of the top five Industries we train out of 161 different Industries okay let's say this is an inbound lead you're meeting them virtually now we train solar door too and virtually I'm looking down at my notes after ask him can you hear me can you see me okay so it looks like you had booked on the calendar about looking at you know possible ways to maybe lowerer your bill and and lock in your rate right now if I'm selling solar what is the end result of solar the end result is to lower their bill and lock in their rate see how I'm automatically getting that Prospect into results based thinking looks like You' booked on the counter about looking at possible ways to lower your bill and lock in your rate right lower your bill and lock in your rate right look at my hands visually that's a whole another training I could do for you right so that's the end result let me show you a few other examples you ready for this okay let's say if you sold life insurance okay huge industry I think it's the first or second largest industry we train now tens of thousands of Agents we train now let's say that this is an outbound call now let's say it's a new lead okay that just responded like an hour before and let's say they responded on a Facebook ad now there's going to be tweaks for this industry and a lot of Industries if they respond to an ad on Facebook and it's like an hour ago compared to them let's say if you're an insurance you would know they fill out some type of mail card they get in the mail and they mail it in and then somebody calls them a week later completely different way we would start off this conversation I'll show you the differences here but I want you to see how we're getting them into results based thinking from the very first questions out of her mouth hey is this John remember this is on the phone hey is this John yeah hey hey John it's Jeremy Miner from XYZ looks like you had responded to an ad on Facebook a few hours ago about at looking at maybe some different options for like you know financial protection for the family when something does happen to you right see how I'm doing that that is a brand new lead if it's an age lead we would not do that you would get crushed in this industry looks like you had responded to an ad so I'm reminding them they responded to an ad on Facebook a few hours ago about looking at maybe some different options for coverage for the family when something happens to you right yeah right okay automatically results Bas thinking now if let's say they filled out some type of card mailed it off you're talking to them to a couple days later and let's say that you bought the lead so you didn't generate the lead off social media you bought the lead from a lead broker and they might have sold it to 20 other agents if you're in that industry that's as you know pretty common so I have to hand handle a little bit different all right let me show you the differences there hey is this John now remember look at the end result here hey yeah hey s yeah this is just uh Jeremy Miner I had a second to get back to you I'm licensed with the state here in Arizona and I received a request that you put in about possibly looking at like different coverage options were you looking at anything specific or just wanting to look at all the different options now let me break down what I just did there for you why would I use the word just there okay a lot of sales trainers will say if you use the word just it diminishes what your message is not important the problem is is your prospects don't care if your message is important or not you're a salesperson and you have zero trust and zero credibility when you first called this type of lead who's being called by 20 other people you don't have any trust or credibil your prospects don't give a rats ass if you were important so the word just in this context now there's some context you wouldn't want to use just but in this context when you're calling an age lead or if you're cold calling the word just implies what that they should already be familiar with it yeah it's just Uncle Bob you know calling back like see that's I'm applying that they should already know me that lowers your prospect's guard in this context this is good in another context you wouldn't use the word J yeah it's just it's just Jeremy Miner I I just had a second to get back to you I'm licensed with the state here in Missouri and received your request that you put in about possible you know but possibly looking at some different coverage options were you looking at anything specific or just wanting to look at all the different options now here I'm neutralizing about possibly looking at different coverage options you always want to say options here if you're calling it a more of an age lead and then I'm automatically in were you looking at anything specific or just wanting to look at all the different options they'll always say I want to look at all the different options so it's automatically getting them into saying and agreeing to me yeah I just want to look at all the different options and then I'm going to go right in to my next question what is the end result looking at different coverage options okay little bit of a different tweak there all right let me show you a few more now if you want more of these or if you want to learn like what questions to ask right after this uh you're welcome to subscribe to this uh YouTube channel because we do a lot more trainings around kind of what to do after this that might help you my only suggestion if you subscribe to this channel do not share it with people who are competing with you so if you got a good buddy or somebody you know that like literally is in your industry working for another company you probably don't want them to know about any of this training on this channel so if you are going to share if you're going to subscribe make sure you keep it to yourself or share it with uh friends of yours who are not in your industry just a word of advice there all right so let's say if you sell for a marketing agency and you have an inbound lead okay so you help uh companies probably smaller companies in this case uh could be larger but mainly smaller companies and you help them generate maybe more leads or a higher quality lead look at look at the difference here okay all right so look down your notes okay so it looks like can you hear me can you see me that same thing okay so it looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at getting maybe a a higher quality lead to help you guys scale the business right now if I'm selling for a marketing agency what is in result I'm not selling them leads I'm selling them what the results of what the leads do which is to help scale the business that's what you're selling about getting a higher quality lead to help scale the business right every business owner say yeah right you don't want to say looks like you booked on the calendar about getting a higher quality lead right some people be like yeah yeah yeah I'm just kind of looking around you want to sell the end result of what you're doing in this case scaling the business okay let me show you another one let's say okay I'm going to show you difference here let's say if you go meet in the home or let's say if you meet in an office maybe you're you're selling uh maybe Enterprise or SMB and you're meeting them at the office there's going to be some different tweaks to both us let's say you sell HVAC huge industry weet Trin as well as you know marketing agencies huge industry ret Trin as well so let's say you sell HVAC and you're coming out to their home home for an appointment okay okay so you know you get in all that stuff okay so okay looks like according to my notes now correct me if I'm wrong but according to my notes looks like you had one of our technicians out here the other day Ryan and you had recently scheduled about looking at you know possibly upgrading your heating you know cooling system to get kind of your air circulating better in the upstairs right see end result if I'm selling HVAC what is the end result of HVAC up now possibly I don't want to say you had you had asked us to come out because you were wanting to upgrade your heating and cooling system some people will say yes other people like well we're still looking around you know we're just kind of looking around at some different options and automatically their guard just came up you want to keep their guard down so when I say the word looking at possibly at possibly upgrading your heating cooling system then I'm going to repeat back the end result so you can get your air circulating better in the upstairs right they're going to be like yeah right see how I'm getting them into results base thinking that is how you build rapport in a prospect's mind you are raising your status where they start to view you this is the start of it there's a lot more after it they start to view you more as the expert or the authority because you're getting them into results based thinking you want to stay away away from the fake Rapport how you doing today how's your day going now if the prospect says hey how you doing today and they ask you you can say ohh you know just hanging out being the boring guy what about you I can be playful oh just hanging out you know trying to stay out of trouble what are you doing over there well you get in trouble in your neck of the woods see that's a playful tone a little bit of a difference there hope that helped you today if you want more training videos on what to ask after these questions or if they say something you don't want them to say you're welcome to subscribe to this channnel we do a lot more training on this channel for that hope that helped you today enjoy
