Comprehensive Guide for Handling Incoming Phone Calls in Car Sales

Introduction
The incoming call is a critical part of the sales process. It’s often the first interaction a customer has with your dealership, and making a positive impression sets the stage for a successful relationship. Your primary goal on an incoming call is not to sell the vehicle but to set an appointment and encourage the customer to visit the dealership in person.
Key Points:
Answer the phone with a smile, energy, and positivity. This conveys enthusiasm and helps build rapport right from the start.
Stay on script. The script is designed to maximize appointment conversions and guide the customer toward an in-person visit.
The Importance of Focusing the Conversation and Staying on Script in Car Sales
Focusing a conversation means guiding it purposefully toward a specific goal while keeping the customer engaged and comfortable. In car sales, focusing and refocusing the conversation while staying on script is critical for several reasons:

1. Achieving the Primary Goal: Setting an Appointment
The ultimate aim of an incoming call is to bring the customer into the dealership, not to sell a car over the phone.
Why It Matters: Decisions are best made in person, where you can create an emotional connection to the vehicle and present options effectively.
Example: If the customer starts focusing on price, refocusing redirects them with:
“Great question! Let’s explore all your options when you visit—it’s the best way to ensure you get exactly what you want.”


2. Maintaining Control of the Conversation
Customers may inadvertently derail the call by asking detailed questions about financing, features, or availability that can be better addressed in person.
Why It Matters: Staying on script keeps the conversation structured, allowing you to remain in control while maximizing the chance of setting an appointment.
Example: When a customer asks about financing:
“That’s an important consideration! When we meet, I’ll introduce you to our finance expert who can tailor options to your budget.”



3. Staying on Script Ensures Consistency
Why It Matters: Scripts are designed to maximize results. They are carefully crafted to convert inquiries into dealership visits while addressing common customer concerns.
Going off script can lead to missed opportunities, overloading the customer with information, or losing sight of the primary goal.
Example: When a customer insists on detailed pricing:
“Your best leverage for getting the deal you want is by visiting in person. Let’s find a time that works for you so we can go over all the details together.”


4. Building Trust and Professionalism
Focusing and staying on script shows confidence and expertise, assuring the customer they are in capable hands.
Why It Matters: Customers value a guide who can simplify their journey and focus on their needs.
Example: When a customer mentions uncertainty, respond with:
“That’s exactly why we encourage visits—we’ll show you all your options with zero pressure, so you can decide what’s best for you.”


5. Preventing Information Overload
Answering too many questions over the phone can overwhelm customers or satisfy their curiosity without compelling them to visit.
Why It Matters: Scripts ensure you share just enough information to build interest while saving key details for the dealership visit.
Example: If the customer asks about specific features:
“Let’s check that out together! That way, you can see and experience it firsthand.”

6. Managing Expectations
Refocusing helps align the customer's expectations with reality, minimizing misunderstandings about pricing, inventory, or offers.
Why It Matters: Staying on script ensures clarity, leaving no room for misinterpretation or confusion.
Example: If the customer fixates on price:
“Your best leverage for getting the deal you want is by visiting in person, where we can explore all current incentives and options.”



Conclusion: Focusing, Refocusing, and Staying on Script Creates Results
By focusing, refocusing, and sticking to the script:
You stay aligned with the primary goal: setting an appointment to increase the likelihood of a sale.
You guide the customer professionally, building trust and reducing uncertainty.
You maintain control, ensuring the call achieves its purpose without getting sidetracked.
You maximize results: The script is a proven tool that simplifies the process, helps handle objections, and keeps conversations efficient.


The Importance of Focusing the Conversation and Using the Script
        Why the Script Matters
The script is designed to guide conversations with customers, ensuring the call stays focused on the ultimate goal: setting an appointment. Without the script, calls often lack structure, leading to missed opportunities and lower appointment show rates. Here’s how using the script and focusing the conversation impacts success:




The Math Behind Script Usage and Show Rates
The percentage of customers who show up for appointments is directly tied to how much of the script is used. Here's the breakdown:
No Script: 25% show rate
Without the script, the conversation can go off track. Customers may feel uncertain, uncommitted, or lose interest because their objections aren’t handled properly.
50% Script Usage: 45% show rate
Using half the script nearly doubles the show rate. This happens because partial adherence starts to address customer concerns and keeps the conversation more focused.
75% Script Usage: 55% show rate
Following most of the script increases the show rate even more. At this level, you’re addressing objections, maintaining professionalism, and presenting appointment options clearly.
90%+ Script Usage: 75% show rate
Sticking to almost the entire script ensures the best results. Customers feel confident, informed, and motivated to show up because their concerns are handled and the call stays focused on the appointment.

The Importance of Focusing the Conversation
Focusing (and refocusing) the conversation ensures you:
Achieve the Primary Goal: Setting the appointment, not answering every possible question.
Maintain Control: Customers often want to discuss price, features, or financing over the phone. Staying focused keeps the conversation on track.
Build Trust: A professional and structured call reassures the customer they’re in capable hands.

Avoid Overloading: Too much information can overwhelm the customer or reduce their urgency to visit the dealership.
Manage Expectations: A focused conversation aligns the customer’s expectations with reality, making them more likely to follow through on their appointment.
Psychology Breakdown of Staying on Track
People Tend to Digress: Customers may try to take the conversation in a different direction. Politely guide it back to the script.
Mental Anchoring: By following the structure, you’re setting a mental anchor in the customer’s mind that they will meet with you in person.
Consistency: Staying on track and reiterating key points makes you appear organized and committed, traits that customers value in a salesperson.


Key Takeaway
No Script: 25% show rate.
50% Script: 45% show rate.
75% Script: 55% show rate.
90%+ Script: 75% show rate.
The more of the script you use and the more you focus the conversation, the better your results. The script ensures every call stays professional, builds trust, and gets customers through the door, giving you more opportunities to close deals.
Step-by-Step Script for Incoming Calls
Step 1: Initial Greeting
Script: “Thank you for calling [Dealership Name]. My name is (________), how may I help you?”
Psychology Insight: Starting with an enthusiastic and welcoming tone helps the customer feel valued. Using your name also personalizes the call and establishes trust.

Step 2: Handling Generic Inquiries
If the customer doesn’t mention a specific vehicle:
Script: “So I can meet your needs, I have a few questions I would like to ask you.”
Ask THREE Qualifying Questions: Closed-ended questions are key to keeping control of the conversation and steering it toward an appointment.
Examples:
“Do you prefer cloth or leather seats?”
“Would you like a sunroof or no sunroof?”
“Do you prefer lighter or darker shades of color?”
Psychology Insight: Asking closed-ended questions with two options keeps the conversation structured and focuses on the customer’s preferences. It also subtly positions you as a professional, knowledgeable guide.
Step 3: Handling Specific Vehicle Inquiries
If the customer inquires about a specific vehicle:
Script: “Oh, that’s a nice one! We’ve had quite a few calls on this one.”
Check Availability Prompt: “I will check on its availability in a minute, but before I do that, were there any other cars you saw online that caught your eye?”
Psychology Insight: This response shows enthusiasm and urgency, which subtly increases the customer’s interest in the vehicle. Asking if they’ve seen any other cars opens up their options and prevents disappointment if the specific car is unavailable.

Step 4: Get Their Information
Script: “I need to verify with a manager to see if that car is still available, and that’s going to take me about 10 minutes. Are you calling from home or work?”
Then, gather their contact details:
Script: “And that number is?” (Get phone number)
Script: “How do I spell your LAST name?” “And your first name is?” (Get both names)

Psychology Insight: People often don’t want to wait on the line for an answer, so they’re more likely to share their contact details. By asking politely and confidently, you ensure they feel it’s a standard, professional process.

 Setting the Appointment
Core Principle: Your primary goal is to secure an appointment. Use assertive language to guide the customer to commit.
Step 5: Hold and Check Availability
Script: “Oh, can I put you on hold for just a moment? My manager just walked into the room, and I should be able to get that information right now.”
Count to 15 to simulate checking.

Script: “Thank you for holding. Based on our inventory, we (1) have the car available, or (2) have great availability.”


Psychology Insight: This gives the impression of a busy, high-demand dealership, enhancing the customer’s urgency to visit in person.

Step 6: Offer Appointment Options
Script: “Speaking of availability, are you more available now or later today?”
Give Two Options on the :15 or :45 of the hour, morning or afternoon.
Example: “We have openings today at 11:15 or 3:15. Which time works better for you?”
If they hesitate, suggest a phone follow-up or tentative appointment.
Psychology Insight: Offering specific times helps reduce decision fatigue. Choosing between two options psychologically nudges them toward making a commitment.

Handling Objections
Stay Focused: Customers may try to steer the conversation off track, such as asking about prices or negotiating over the phone. Always bring the conversation back to the appointment.
Script for Price Inquiry:
If they ask for the price, provide it.
If they ask, “Is that your best price?” respond with:
Script: “Your best leverage is being here in person.”
Psychology Insight: The phrase “best leverage” encourages the customer to believe they have negotiating power, which they can only utilize by visiting the dealership. It subtly implies that in-person interactions yield better results.
Common Phone Objections and Responses:

"I don’t want to come in without knowing the best price"
Response: "I completely understand! Many of our customers feel the same way. Once you’re here, we can go over everything in detail and ensure you get the best possible deal.”

"I’m just looking around and not ready to commit yet"
Response: "That’s perfect! We’re here to help, and an appointment will allow us to show you options and answer your questions without any pressure."

"I live too far away to come in without knowing everything"
Response: "I understand the distance! Our appointments are designed to save you time. We’ll have everything ready for you when you arrive, so it’ll be a quick, efficient experience."



Securing the Appointment
Step 7: Confirm the Appointment Details
Once they agree to a time:
Script: “Do you have a pen or pencil available?”
Repeat the details:
Spell your name slowly.
Confirm the customer’s phone number.
Mention that you’ll send directions and your contact information.
Psychology Insight: Confirming details creates a sense of formality and commitment, which reduces the likelihood of a no-show.
Step 8: Provide Directions and Reinforce the Appointment
Script: “Do you know where we are located? If you’re running late, please give me a call or text.”
Repeat the appointment time to reinforce it in their mind.
Psychology Insight: Directions and reminders provide clarity and prevent miscommunication, building trust in your professionalism.
Step 9: Wrap-Up
Script: “Awesome, I will see you at (Time) on (Date). We’re looking forward to helping you find your perfect vehicle!”
Conclusion
An incoming call is an opportunity to make a great first impression, demonstrate professionalism, and ultimately, secure an in-person appointment. Remember:
Stay on script to guide the conversation effectively.
Use psychology to your advantage by subtly reinforcing the importance of visiting the dealership.
Express enthusiasm and positivity throughout the call.
