what is up car sales people it is christopher here from cars unlocked today we're going to be discussing how to smash it on the phone book appointments so that you can sell more cars my name is christopher this is cars unlocked and i just want to say thank you to everybody who reached out to me about car sales this is kind of a branch off of my car sales training videos a lot of you guys reached out to me asking me questions on instagram dms in the comments greatly appreciated but i just want to say thank you for that and some of you requested that we talk about how to use the phone to sell more cars and this is something that i pride myself in i feel like i'm very good at using the phone and using the phone in car sales is key so you guys need to learn and we're going to go through some of the things that i've learned that's helped me book more appointments help me sell more cars and just talk about phone sales in general and how you can use the phone to crush more deals so let's jump right into it basically what i've always thought about in my life and what someone told me a long time ago that you guys should remember when you're selling cars is a good salesperson knows what to do when they have a customer in front of them a great salesman knows what to do when they don't have a customer in front of you so if you're not busy you should be on the phone you should be texting calling emailing your customers and you should be knowing that you need to be booking appointments we're gonna go through who you should be calling how to make those calls some different techniques i use on the phone that's helped me book more appointments and how you can increase your appointments and then we're gonna finish up with the follow-up so let's jump right into starting who you should call i've trained a handful of sales representatives and i've heard from other co-workers things like that a lot of people say when we ask about using the phone they say chris i don't have anybody to call and that's nonsense there's always someone to call there's always people that you should be calling someone you should be following up with if you say you don't have someone to call that's just your excuse for the right to be lazy there's always someone to call service customers are great to call you can ask your sales manager for a list of maybe orphan customers people who haven't don't have aren't assigned to a sales rep maybe their sales person quit or their salesperson left their kind of orphan customers house customers is another word that people call them people coming in for service you should be calling those people they're coming in anyway so those are the perfect people to call previous customers that you didn't close previous ups that have come in maybe you didn't close them on that day you should be following up with them anybody you sold over a year ago you can call them and ask them if they want to upgrade and we're going to get into that right now there's a lot of people that you can call repeat customers any internet leads that you have there's always someone you can call and that's that one of my first steps is knowing that there's always someone to call let's jump into how you should be making these calls right away to start so first thing that i like to do is i just want to let you guys know you should be efficient in these calls i like to call for my cell phone sometimes i call from the dealership phone the office phone i change it up every now and then just so there's a few different numbers calling my customers but i like to be efficient in my calls and when i say be efficient in my calls i use a crm system that my dealership has provided for me so i can track all my phone calls and i can call the numbers quickly your dealership should have some sort of customer management system or crm system that you use and then in terms of efficiency i also use a headset so i have a wireless headset that connects to my phone via bluetooth and that way i can call it makes it a lot easier when i'm calling for example i can do things on my computer if i have the headset on while i'm typing i can pull up information pull up vehicle information while i'm talking to customers and i just don't always have to keep raising my phone to my ear doing this things like that get yourself a wireless headset and that's gonna also help you when you're making calls and make you more efficient i also use different apps um text messaging assistant so i use uh an android phone i use the messengers app and basically it allows me to send text messages right from my desktop here and that makes it a lot easier for me i can quickly bang out text messages i'm not always typing with my thumbs and i also use different templates for emails and sending text messages for customers you'll find that when you're following up with customers you consistently repeating yourself in your emails and text messages if you catch yourself repeating yourself many times it's good to save those emails templates or those messages onto a clipboard or a document so that you can just copy and paste them into your text message assistant that's what i do it helps me be more efficient i use a google extension it's called permanent clipboard and essentially it allows me to save all different clips onto my clipboard i can just bang them off quickly and all i have to change is really the customer's name um with just follow-up messages that i send to people so also when you're on the phone a big tip here guys is you want to have a positive tone you want to be excited when you're making phone calls i'm excited to make this video for you i also show the same excitement as i'm making calls the positivity will flow through the phone and your customer will pick up on that positivity if you're not looking forward to making calls or you're a little pissed off or you're monotone or you're not excited you're not smiling you're not talking with your hands that's why a headset is a good thing it will reflect through the phone and your customer won't get that positive call that you're looking to accomplish so make sure your tone your actions everything is positive you're smiling while you're doing it i just like to make a game out of it i like to have fun when i'm making phone calls sometimes i joke with my co-workers sometimes i joke with my customers and i'm calling and that positivity and that light heartedness reflects through the phone and makes it easier when you're booking appointments you're going to make making phone calls a daily habit of your car sales career the phone is one of your biggest tools and you should just know that you're coming to work every day and you're going to make phone calls that's just make a habit of it enjoy it if you don't like using the phone every day you're in the wrong industry and you have the wrong career you need to enjoy using the phone and you need to enjoy making phone calls and that positivity will reflect through the phone another tip that i have is just understanding what you're trying to accomplish when you're on the phone so the biggest goal of the phone is not to sell the car your goal is to book an appointment so i've said this in my previous videos you're in the apartment business you're not in the car business your goal of every phone call is to book an appointment so understanding that that's the goal you're gonna be more effective you're booking an appointment for the customer to come in and potentially purchase a car for you you're not selling them the car over the phone you're booking an appointment with them to come into the dealership over the phone and i'm gonna get into how you can accomplish that i'm gonna share something with you a tool that i use when i first started in car sales that i still use to this day that it's almost like a given script that i use when i'm making phone calls and it's helped me book so many appointments and it's helped me um sell a lot of cars so i'm gonna share this with you right now it's extremely powerful for me and someone taught this to me a long time ago and i'm gonna pass this on to you guys and that is using a confirmation code when making your calls your confirmation code is a code that you use when making calls to help increase your appointment ratio increase your customers that will show up increase the incentives that you have to offer and also just give you a reason to make these calls and call these people it can be used to target any types of customers that i mentioned earlier from the service customers from the repeat customers from your internet leads whatever type of leads that you have fresh leads follow-up it's going to really help basically you can create any sort of confirmation code you just want to make something easy for you to remember a confirmation code and you're going to call the customers and offer them this confirmation code as an exclusive discount that you're offering them for this sale there's always some sort of sale going on at your dealership we all know that being in car sales there's a sale every month black friday boxing week summer clearout event 2021 clear out event whatever the sale is you're going to use this confirmation code essentially you're going to call your customer and say hello mr mr customer this is christopher from abc motors customer service i like to say i'm from customer service so it doesn't sound a little sales pitchy this is christopher from abc motors customer service i got great news for you today we have this exclusive confirmation code given from our manufacturer that's going to unlock some savings if you want to come into the dealership and participate in our so and so sales event our black friday event or our clear out event and upgrade your vehicle basically the confirmation code will work something somewhere like that um a real life example like no matter what you're gonna use the sale but i would say hello mr mr customer this is christopher here's your confirmation code do you have a pen handy write this confirmation code down cuz 457-2021 we're going to have you bring this confirmation code in it's going to unlock some exclusive sales event savings for you if you're interested in upgrading your vehicle when is your next day off you're available to come to the dealership okay great you're available tuesday now tuesday would you prefer morning or afternoon okay great morning i have a 9 15 or 10 15 available which time works for you 10 15 perfect mrs customer i'm gonna lock in that 10 15 and we're going to send you an email confirmation of your appointment please bring in the confirmation code and we'll unlock your savings when you come in and we run the code it will give you access to our exclusive sales event so that works great you'll notice some of the word tracking that i use is very important which i'm going to get to in a second but it's very fast it doesn't give the customer a much time to think about what they're doing they just want to book it in and use the exclusivity of the confirmation code and book an appointment with you and then you're going to follow up with them and send them a confirmation you might be wondering um like where do the discounts come from for the confirmation code well i'm assuming your dealership is the same as mine but at my dealership there's always some sort of discount to offer the customers we always have some sort of sale some sort of loyalty event oil change promotions we always have something and when the customer comes in we take their confirmation code i say great news mr mr customer i ran your confirmation code and you were unlocked maybe free oil changes for three years or you unlocked a free set of floor mats with your car purchased you unlocked a 500 discount you unlock the thousand dollar loyalty savings whatever discount you can work out or you want to work out with your management staff you can run the code and you can unlock it we can go through some objections some customers say might ask you on the phone well what does the confirmation code get me right away you'll want to say to them it works as like a scratch lottery ticket where we don't know what it unlocks until you bring it in and we run it and we attach it to the vehicle that you choose to upgrade to so we need you to come in pick out a vehicle evaluate your trade and we'll run your confirmation code and then we'll it will unlock some savings to you and you need to hype up the confirmation code when your appointment shows up and this will just give them some urgency to buy so it's very fast use the confirmation code if you guys have questions about the confirmation code i can get into more detail just send me a dm and i'd be more than happy to ask you guys or answer any of your questions you guys have about the confirmation code but you'll notice in the example that i use some of the word tracking that i use so this is just a few closing tips that i have for you guys when using the confirmation code or just calling customers in general you want to only ask open-ended questions so you'll notice when i use that example i said to them when is your next day off not when can you come in if you say when can you come in the customer might say oh i'm busy all week or this not but if you say when is your next day off no matter what day they say to you they're going to instantly think oh my day off is tuesday okay tuesday works for me what do you prefer morning or afternoon instead of asking them what time works for them they might say oh i'm busy all day if you say do you prefer morning or afternoon no matter what answer to your question is a positive answer for you okay mr customer you're available in the morning i have a 9 15 or a 10 15. giving them two options both answers that you want to hear instead of asking them what time works for you they might say oh i'm unsure of the time i'll let you know but if you just tell them i have a 9 15 or a 10 15 it's going to be nice easy quick painless option for creating an appointment because no matter what option they say it's an answer that you want to hear so keep that in mind always ask questions that have two answers that are both positive answers open-ended questions um the next thing you want to do is confirm your appointments so right after you get off the phone with your customer and you book an appointment using the confirmation code or you don't use the confirmation code send them a text message or an email pleasure talking to you on the phone this is christopher where i'm confirming your appointment for tuesday at 9 15. this is the address please let me know if anything changes that's key sending that email right away so they have it in writing they know okay i've booked in my appointment i'm locked in i got to bring in my confirmation code and then it wouldn't hurt to follow them uh follow up with them the night before or maybe the day the day before and just confirm their appointment so that they're coming in maybe they need to reschedule but confirming your appointment is big guys and also following up with your customers if they don't show for their appointment is also big another key thing that i learned is never to turn down any appointments i'll book myself seven appointments at the same time if i have to if i'm on the phone with a customer and they say i want to come in at 9 15 and i have another customer scheduled at nine i'm not going to say oh can you change it to 9 45 i'm not going to adjust my schedule for them i'm just going to lock in the appointment because i know customers come sometimes they don't come sometimes they come late sometimes they come early so i just try to book as many appointments as i can and if two customers show up at the same time i'll deal with it at that time and i'll roll with the punches but that rarely happens just book as many appointments as you can don't be concerned about overlapping appointments or the time frame just book as many as you can because you know things will change the day of customer might come early later that's pretty much uh a quick rundown of how i use the confirmation code guys hopefully this explained a lot hopefully this helps you guys if you guys have questions send me a dm on instagram at cvam weekend comment in the comment section subscribe to my channel i'm gonna be doing more sales videos like this and if you guys need help with anything i'm here for you guys hopefully we can learn and grow together and i love hearing some of your guys comments of what you guys use on the phone how you've been successful on the phone um and
