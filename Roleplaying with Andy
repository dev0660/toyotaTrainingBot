hey guys what's going on it's andy i'm here today with my man luke smith hey guys check this out this is going to be a video that you guys have been asking about so i do a lot of overcoming objections and role playing on videos the reason why is so salespeople can actually watch another salesperson getting pounded on and then guess what he's got to take the no and then overcome it and what my goal is when you're practicing role play okay one of the biggest problems that a lot of sales people find themselves doing is overselling okay and that's not what we want to do so why i choose and why i chose these 10 objections is because i want to give luke the objection and i want him to overcome it but i don't want him to give me a giant story i want him to have something tattooed on his heart where he can just fire back at me okay we're hearing our lines then we've been traveling all week long all around the country guys it's going to be a crazy month we're on the road i want to tell you now's the time to elevate your game if you really want to crush your competition that's asleep with the will now's this time to do it the next five years are going to be ours i want to create the most elite sales people in the country but you got to be able to handle objections blocking and tackling is crucial for salespeople remember this objections are something that people will give you before they buy something so an objection could be a stall right like basically it really doesn't mean anything i'm just trying to talk myself back out of buying it and then the salesman's job is to go ahead and push the customer through to go and purchase it or there could be a real objection and then you overcome it and you handle it okay so i got luke here with me luke is going to go ahead and handle these 10 objections that i've put here on the board this is going to be awesome you guys are going to love it but also i got a little bonus objection right here okay at the end so i'm going to have luke run through all 10 at the end i'm going to hit him with the bonus objection i'm not going to say if he gets it right or wrong i'm going to leave it up to you give us a comment below let us know how well luke does and here we go all right so here we go all right overcoming objections we're going to start out with number one hey guys it's andy i hope you're enjoying the video if you are please like and subscribe below also click on the link below join me in a free strategy session i'd love to help you set up a game plan to crush it let's get back to the video this is my first stop whether this is your first stop or your last stop i'm just grateful to have the opportunity to help you buy a vehicle you see at our dealership we're high on all the critical areas that are important to your family such as trade-ins payments and price so come on let's see if we can find a vehicle together i love it love it okay all right let's go to number two this is going to be i just think the price is too high so i'm going to give you a scenario here real quick one of the best ways to role play is to physically build a scenario okay so that one would be outside on the lot this one would be inside okay we're negotiating inside i'm asking for a better deal and guess what luke knows i don't have a real reason why i need a better deal i'm just trying yawn for a better deal go i just think the price is too high okay so other than the payments or other than the price um the payments are good sure the payments are fine i'm not worried so the payments are okay so the price you just think the price is too high do you mind being more specific on why you think the price is too high i just think it's too high hey this is completely my fault i didn't explain our pricing policy to your front you see 90 of our customers want the best price up front the other 10 percent still want to negotiate and haggle you see we find this completely just untrustworthy and disrespectful you see i don't just want to sell you a car today i want to sell you a car for the rest of your life if i were to mark the price up three thousand dollars we negotiate and haggle go back and forth and i lower the price three thousand dollars is that trustworthy in any way in any way no no you see so have i offended you by giving you my best price up front not at all perfect thank you sign here ah looky boy nice okay i'm just looking i'm just looking luke great that takes all the pressure off me the way i view it it's sort of like dating you don't know when it's gonna happen but you have to make a move when you find the right one so let's go see if we can find a vehicle you like together what do you guys think how's luke doing all right guys let's go to number four i want to make sure let's set the stage here let's set the scenario so he can understand it i want to make sure you're not taking advantage of my girlfriend i'm sitting down i'm the boyfriend i'm the six month boyfriend right you know that guy right he's the six month boyfriend he's sitting here and he says hey let's say luke presents the numbers to it to my girlfriend and i'm gonna be the third party or maybe a second baseman i'm gonna say hey hold on man i wanna make sure not taking advantage of my girlfriend okay awesome you're such a good boyfriend i didn't realize that she had somebody helping her with her financial responsibilities so today will you be taking care of the down payment the monthly payments are both well none of them okay i completely understand so this is her car and i want to make sure that she understands with her financial responsibilities that this is the vehicle that she's going to be buying or by herself today is that okay if i speak with her okay all right i got you luke i got you luke hey that one can be a little confrontational right we can tweak that one but his word tracks are spot on there's some really good stuff that he said we can pull that out all right all right number five look i need to think about it all right we're on the lot i've checked the car out you showed it to me you just test drove it you know what with me and i get out and you trial close me go ahead okay hey so we'll be putting this loan in your name or both your names you and your wife today uh it's gonna be just my name okay perfect awesome so follow me inside i'll get you a five minute proposal and we'll get going oh yeah yeah we're we're not ready for that we're just we just need to think about it okay of course you need to think about it i haven't given you enough information not to think about it what i like to do is go inside and give you a five minute proposal of all the figures so when you go home tonight with your wife and you're sitting down at the kitchen table you truly have something to think about would that be fair sure okay great follow me inside okay good job luke all right we're going to number six now and by the way guys look i want to talk to you about luke for just a second okay i always like to talk about different levels of skill okay luke has been in the car business for less than one month okay less than one month i want to explain this to you luke smith has been in the car business for less than one month now here's the deal he's extremely smart he obviously has put in the time to train and guess what when i'm hitting them with this imagine how many people run around the lot and less than a month can't overcome a simple objection when you do training you start to elevate your game extremely fast we're gonna keep going here but i have a feeling just within the next week or two or three weeks or four weeks he will gain more ground than a lot of salespeople will in years we call this turning decades into days with new training okay so with that being said as you're watching him go through this keep checking him out guys we're doing this less than a month that's amazing i'm just telling the fact that he has an answer i haven't seen him get triggered and really get tripped up yet and that's great okay so as he continues to grow and even as i continue to grow every single day and just like you it is nice to see at different levels with our car sales nation our group our family our tribe we're rising to the top this is awesome man all right so number six i'm working to deal with you luke you present the numbers okay and i say hey i don't have any money for a down payment okay so you don't have any money down or money for the down payment that is complete that's that's completely okay so what we actually do is most of our customers at the store put the down payment on a credit card so that way it's convenient for you to pay it off when you'd like to you know the banks like to see a little bit of customer participation to help with better rates and approvals okay cool so you get to put it on your credit card i love it man all right number seven okay can you give me the price oh this is a good one customer's out on a lot and he says hey you know what i don't just want a price here because i want a price on all three of these cars okay i understand sir so let me ask you this if all three of these cars were the exact same price which one can you see yourself owning because that's the price the car matters on the most okay so probably that one okay great let's go grab the keys this one touch it feel the smell and see if this is the vehicle you like to own we'll take the job all right with that being said let's go to number eight i just need to think this through luke i just need to think this through okay i understand so on a scale of one to ten with 10 being let's go right now and one being i don't want it even if it was free where are you at seven okay so you're a seven what would bring you to that ten um i don't know maybe a set of wheels set of wheels you know what we can let's see if we can go get that taken care of for you he keeps it moving forward good job luke all right let's go to number nine remember i got a bonus one about to drop right here number nine we don't need to test drive the car this is a common one i just drove one like it down the road i don't need to drive this one whatever we don't need to test drive this car okay i completely understand a test drive doesn't have to be long but it's always necessary even if it's down the service road turning around and coming straight back we take lots of pride in servicing our vehicles and that's going to be seen and felt when you drive it so come on hop in let's just go right down the road there you go bud he got the test drive going that's the number one deal i've watched managers throw salespeople through the window before for not driving a car okay so if that was ever something you have an issue with i think what he said is great i love it all right number 10 you are a thousand dollars higher than your competitor okay on price yes we are a thousand dollars higher and the reason why we're a thousand dollars higher is why we're high on all the other critical areas as well such as payments price and trading you see great business doesn't work that way we can't be the lowest in price and the highest in business okay i like it so we say hey man look we are a little higher in price but also we're hiring all the other critical areas that are important to you and your family right yeah and also we're great at a lot of other areas other than just the price but we can't be the highest in business and the lowest in price sir great business doesn't work that way and then you can even follow through with you know hey who wants the cheapest right i don't like cheating nobody of course right and you came in today for value value for the price even if you got a little lower price you can't put price in your driveway but you can put value and this part you're getting value for the price and we're taking care of all these areas so you can follow through with it guys we got a last little bonus objection right here okay guys i've got hundreds of these look i could have picked any objection here for luke okay and by the way luke probably had about 30 seconds to get prepared i said hey man we're gonna shoot a quick video let's go all right i'm physically taking luke under my wing i'm mentoring him and we are taking him to an all new level this is a guy who has not sold cars who just got in and is picking up on it really quick he's putting in the work he's paying the price in advance and i'm telling you when i say this this is how fast somebody can shift and change and become great at something so i threw these random objections up there and by the way he doesn't get on camera a lot so this is awesome for him in front of a camera is probably a little bit nervous too guys he did a really good job i'm really proud of him hey good job man there we go brotherhood i'm proud of him real quick guys there's nothing like between you and i that are different it takes me a long time to actually learn something when i study it when i first found andy and i saw his word tracks i i bought his his membership and i started writing all of these down i wrote them down on flash cards and i took those flash cards and i typed them in on quizlet and i tapped around on quizlet and then when i actually did too is i said the five objections i did a video on my phone did those five objections right next video next five next video next five and when i'm in my car all i do is literally hit play on bluetooth and listen to myself going through these objections over and over and over again that's great yeah repetition's the mother of skill man that's awesome and by the way i did the same thing when i was younger so if you're wanting to go all the way to the top and kill it guys i'm just sharing with you there's going to be a whole new level for you you just got to go in and put a little training in there's hundreds of these objections hundreds over here i've got a book with probably 360 objections in them and how to overcome them okay this is luke's way how to overcome them just from watching videos and going in and doing your thing guys i think you did a great job comment below like the video share it with somebody if it'll give them some help but let's let's go with the last objection here okay and this is going to be a good one this is going to be i want my dad to look at the car before i buy it okay so i'm sitting here inside with you all the numbers are on the table okay all right and i said hey man you know what i i want to talk to my dad before i go ahead and buy it okay i completely understand but you already know what your dad's gonna say he's gonna say that you need to buy a car today that you like and you already told me out on the lot that you love it so let's save you some time and on top of that your dad's gonna be proud of you for buying this vehicle on your own guys what that is awesome why because people need to make their own decisions we don't want to involve a father a mother a grandpa a grandma or anybody like that that's going to say hey you know what luke why don't why don't i just get back with you tomorrow i'm gonna go talk to my dad tonight and then guess what happens that guy stops at another car dealership down the road and ends up buying okay that is a stall and even if he bought from his last three times getting in touch with the father guess what he needs to make his own decisions okay think about it third parties third parties second baseman you want to keep them out of your deal this is a deal between you and your customer and every time you involve someone else guess what then you involve someone else's opinions and some people's opinions are amazing i'm not saying i don't want to involve a father but listen you're doing it at your own risk because sometimes here's my deal and so overcome the objection and move on that way we don't have to mess with it some some people are like hey you know what let's go ahead and call your dad and see what he has to say but you called the dad and he's like hey man i got a buddy that works at another dealership and i think i think you know what what do they give you for your trade oh man i get you way more than that and then you know what happens you blow your whole deal out overcome it and move on you don't get to pick what kind of father that this customer has okay it's not always going to be a supportive one and maybe that dad had a bad relationship with somebody at the last car lot and that's not you but he doesn't know that because he's not here so he ends up treating you a little bit different okay and then he ends up blowing your deal out so with that being said guys i'm really proud of luke good job man seriously ten objections comment below how you think he did here's what's important when you're judging him he's been doing it for under a month and then lastly the bonus round one which is a tough one i want to um i want to show like the car to my dad before i buy it that is a really really tough one that a lot of salespeople get triggered on and say hey you know what all right hold on let's go ahead and call your dad and then pop says yeah no ways or you don't get to hold the dad and then they're like well when i get a hold of him later i'll get with you man yeah he just passed it said hey man i think your dad would be really proud of you for making a decision on your own we know what your dad's gonna say your dad's gonna say that you're happy you know as long as you're happy with it that's all that matters and you already said you were happy with it so guess what now we're going to save you some time you know it's just really good the words flowed out great i'm really proud of them guys have a great day crush it we're going to be putting out a lot more role play videos and i'm going to keep covering a whole bunch of different objections have a great day hey guys congratulations on
