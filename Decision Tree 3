Final Takeaways for Training Sales Representatives
Assess the Customerâ€™s Engagement Level Quickly

If theyâ€™re neutral but listening, keep it brief and focus on one clear benefit.
If theyâ€™re open but hesitant, encourage engagement through a question.
If theyâ€™re too busy, ask for a follow-up time rather than pushing forward.
Match Their Energy & Interest Level

Mild interest? Give a teaser benefit, then ask a simple question.
Moderate curiosity? Share a quick example or customer success story.
Highly interested? Move toward scheduling a call or demo immediately.
Keep It Conversational & Low Pressure

If theyâ€™re not rejecting outright, always offer a follow-up option (call, email, info packet).
If they push back hard, respectfully end the call and leave the door open for later.
Avoid Talking Too Much Too Soon

A basic customer doesnâ€™t need a deep dive.
Keep it focused on their needs and ask engaging questions instead of giving long explanations.
