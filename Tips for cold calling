[Music] welcome back to another video guys my name is Christopher from Cars unlocked today we're discussing my top 10 tips for making phone calls to help you book more appointments and sell more cars so if you're new here guys welcome to my channel my name is Christopher and I discuss all things related to the automotive industry especially training for future car sales people so if you guys want to level up your game check out my videos subscribe to my channel let's get started with tip number one now tip number one sounds pretty basic but it's going to be just make calls it's as simple as that a lot of new car sales people are hesitant to pick up the phone and call people but if you make it a daily habit of making calls spend one to two hours a day you're gonna get better at it you're gonna book more appointments and you're gonna become more efficient so that's tip number one is just simply get in and do it and start grinding number two is there's always someone to call a lot of people say to me when they're making calls is oh I don't have anybody to call but that's not true there's so many customers you call and that's just you being lazy you can call your past customers you can call orphan customers previous customers that came in and didn't purchase you can call all your leads your internet leads your phone up leads you can call your customers coming in for service you can call some of your customers that have already bought and asking for referrals there's so many people that you can call go through your database at your dealership ask your management for a list of people to call if you need to and just get in and start doing it there's always someone to call our tip number three is that you always want to have a reason for your phone call so you don't just want to call people and say hey how you doing I just want to follow up with you you want to have a reason for your call and what do I mean by a reason for your call this could be maybe you're calling them to introduce a new model maybe you're calling them to talk about a promotion hey Mr Mr customer this vehicle just came in and it made me think of you something like that always have some sort of reason for your call this weekend we're having a very large sale and you can get above and beyond the Black Book value if you're trading in your vehicle hey the bank just gave me a list of all my customers who qualify for a lower interest rate and your name was on it so I'm calling to see if you're interested in getting a lower interest rate on your next vehicle always have a reason for your call and that's going to bring me into my next tip which I've talked about on this channel before and that's use a confirmation code so I've explained what the confirmation code is but it just helps you book more appointments and it helps you do better on the phone so it's basically a code that offers your customers some sort of incentive to book an appointment and come in I'm going to link that video in the description below but that's the next tip is use a confirmation code moving on to tip number five and tip number five is use technology to be efficient so when I make calls I use things like headsets I use my database and the CRM system to just make me more efficient at calls the last thing you want to be doing is picking up your phone and holding it to your ear every time you make a call or having to go like this and type on your computer grab a headset use a CRM system if your dealership doesn't offer you a CRM system you can find a few free ones online but I would recommend you use a headset use a CRM system so you're just more efficient and you can bang out more calls faster tip number six I've said this so many times the goal is not about selling cars remember you're in the appointment business not the car sales business so your goal of every phone call is to book an appointment with your customers to come in not to sell them a car on the phone book them an appointment and once you understand and get that mindset that your goal is to book an appointment you'll achieve more appointments you'll have more customers coming in to see you and you'll have a better and higher closing ratio so remember you're in the appointment business so we're moving right along here guys and make sure you stay to the end because my final tip is is the most deadliest and most valuable tip but the next tip is going to be don't simply just call and what do I mean by that you want to call your customers you want to text your customers and you want to email your customers send them and try to contact them in whichever way you think will work some customers like to respond by text message some customers like to respond by email some customers like to respond by phone so make sure you try all three and then once you get response from their customer use the one that they're comfortable with you can even try Facebook Messenger WhatsApp sending them DMS through social media sometimes works too but make sure you're not only just calling the customers because you'll miss out on those people who want to text with you number eight is just throwing as many darts as you can and what do I mean by this well I look at making phone calls a game of throwing darts now if you started out a game of darts and you only had three darts your chances of booking of hitting a bullseye are very low but if you started out with a hundred darts you'll probably hit a bullseye at one out of those 100 and that's what I mean when you're making calls if you only make three phone calls you're probably not gonna book an appointment for your customer department but if you make a hundred phone calls you'll certainly book an appointment one of those appointments will show and one of them will buy so think about it like that the more calls you make the more chances you have to book unemployment don't look at someone's name or someone's profile and think oh this person's not going to book an appointment or this person's not interested he might as well just give them a call it doesn't hurt what's the worst thing they could say it's going to be no and then you just move on to the next person so guys if you're enjoying the video make sure you guys check out my cars unlocked Academy I've launched a free car sales training webinar for people who are just getting started out in the car business and that's my do's and don'ts of car sales so check that out I'm going to link it in the description below and stay tuned for more updates from my cars on locked Academy program let's move on to number nine and tip number nine is going to be to send confirmations and reminders of your appointment so once you make phone calls and you book an appointment with the client is your job truly finished no you want to send them on a confirmation of their appointment right away and send them reminders up until the day of their appointment maybe send them two reminders one the morning of maybe 1 48 to 20 24 hours before and send them a confirmation of their appointment this locks your appointment in gives the customer something tangible send them the address with the confirmation of your dealership if they've never been here before and make sure they ask for you put that in your confirmation please ask for me when I when you arrive or put your name when they arrive so send in confirmations and reminders will just help increase the amount of customers that show up for your appointments and that's going to increase the amount of sales you get and the last and final tip this one's super valuable and if you guys are not doing this you need to get on this level but you want to send your customers videos and other information through video and social media and that's huge I use apps like Co video and vidyard I'll link them in the description below you can even send them YouTube videos and you can get so much more information across with a video and show them and present the car with the video as opposed to just calling your customer or texting with your customers so use these apps send your customers videos if you want to talk to them about a car and explain the features of the car why not go down there take a video of you explaining those features introducing yourself and then sending it to the customer and calling to follow up on the video like I mentioned earlier about having a reason to call you're calling to discuss the video so keep that in mind guys those are our tips for calling your customers hopefully you guys enjoyed this training
