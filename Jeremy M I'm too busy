how many times does a prospect answer and say you know I'm kind of busy uh I'll get back to you if I'm interested well how do you respond to that to get them to let their guard out come over to the vibe board I'm going to show you what to do now this type of an objection can happen in two parts of the sales process it can happen right at the beginning like if you call outbound leads that means somebody's filled out a a name an email phone number requested information they don't know who's calling or when it's like an outbound lead or a variation can happen at the end of your presentation whether you're in B2B or B to C and the prospect or Prospect say you know what this sounds good just you know let me think it over and I'll get back to you if I'm interested you ever get that one so there's two types of responses I'm going to show you this one first the first thing you have to do you always have to do this if you can't do this it's over is get the prospect to let their guard down if they if you can't get them to let their guard down there is nothing that's going to happen after this okay so if you start to argue or try to throw autal 99 the time it's over okay so you're first going to agree with him you're just going to agree like oh yeah and I've only got a few minutes before my next appointment anyways so you just agree now you're not going to stop right here you're not just going to stop at this sentence I'm just going to deconstruct this for you okay oh yeah and I'm only get a few minutes before my next appointment anyways and just so you know I'm not quite sure we can even help you yet it might not even make sense for you to even have us call you back I'd have to understand probably a little bit more about kind of what you guys are using now for XYZ and the results you're getting from that because maybe you don't even need it it's like for example who do you guys use for and then you go right in to your first what we call npq situation question now do you want me to deconstruct what I just did there okay let's go back so I want to make sure you understand how the brain works typically if a prospect says this at the beginning of a conversation it's because because of probably your tone how you came across with your tonality it triggered what's called fight or flight mode where the the prospect's guards come up and they're just trying to get rid of you they don't even know what you're talking about they're just like fight ORF flight okay so the way you want to disarm them is simply by a green first oh yeah I'm only get a few minutes before my next appointment anyway so I'm a green like I only have a few minutes anyways now why do I say I only have a few minutes before my next appointment anyways because if the prospect feels like you're only going to take a little bit of their time is their guard more than likely going to go down compared to if they think you might take 30 minutes that means our guards up so it's just a disarming Technique we call that a deframe so make sure you write down deframe so every I want I want you to imagine every Prospect you talk to has a belief system or objections or a way of thinking with what we call a frame okay so coming from my background is like studying to be a psychiatrist when I went to school in Behavioral Science we are taught to view everything in frames so humans view everything in frames based on their past history and who they're around right now okay so this Frame is salesperson trying to sell me something I got to get rid of you how do I take them out of that frame I have to deframe them like get them out of the frame and then reframe them into a new way of thinking okay so deframe get them out of their frame their objection or way of thinking then I'm going to reframe them like flip the script reframe them into a new frame or new way of thinking I'll show you how it works all right oh yeah and I've only got a few minutes before my next appointment anyways and just so you know I'm not quite sure we can even help you yet we'd have to know a little bit more about who you're using now with X and kind of the results you're getting from that because maybe you don't even need us for example who do you use now for your and you're going to lean in with more of a soft tone always lean in like this because it kind of restricts your vocal cords and it makes your tone sound a little bit softer like it's more serious what do you use now for and watch how the Prospect opens up now I want to analyze what I did here in the second part so this is the D Frame I'm agreeing oh I've only got a few minutes before my next appointment anyways okay and just so you know I'm not quite sure we can even help you yet why am I saying that do I know I can help them yes does the prospect know you can help them in the first 30 seconds of a sales call no so your first job is to get them to let their guard down and then throughout that conversation build a big enough Gap from where they are to where they want to be where by the end they're like oh my gosh I have to change my situation with this person or with this company all right so that's why I'm disarming them I'm admitting I might not even be able to help them now I'm not negative you're not saying I can't help you might not quite sure if we can even help you see you're still in the middle you're neutral you don't know enough information right then I'm going to go right here it's automatic you don't stop in between yeah we'd have to understand a bit more about who you're using for or what you're doing with it depends on what you s and the results you're getting from that because maybe it might maybe you're better off staying with who you already have or maybe you don't even need us and then you go right into it for example who do you use now for your and you go right into that question okay now this is how you respond to too busy right now I'll call you back if I'm interested you want me to teach you how to respond if at the end of the conversation or presentation they give you this objection I like what you're saying give me some time I'll get back to you if I'm interested stay in tuned here now if you want to learn more techniques on how to disarm your prospect so you prevent a lot of the objections you're getting right now your next step go and hit the Subscribe button my only thing is do not share this Channel with your competitors I can assure you you don't want them learning what I'm going to show you every single week hit the Subscribe button let's get back to work over here okay now let's go over a prospect saying at the end of the conversation hey I appreciate the info I'll get back to you in the next few weeks if I'm interested what in the HL do you do at that point the first thing you have to do is what remember we have to get the prospect to let their guard down we have to disarm them and what do we also have to do do you know why they're not moving forward with you do you know why they're not 100% certain of what you're offering why are they not going forward right now they obviously have some type of concern that they don't want to tell you so unless you can find out what their concern is and help them overcome it you pretty much have what type of chance of getting the steal pretty much zero right maybe one% so do not accept this you will never you will more than likely hardly ever get any sales if you accept them saying this okay so what I'm going to show you is a disarming technique to get them to let their guard down where they feel comfortable enough to open up and tell you what their real concern is I'm going to show you what I'm going to do here okay so hey I'll get back to hey this sounds really good thank you for sharing your presentation everything I'll get back to you in a few weeks if I'm interested okay you're simply going to say well yeah it might be hard to randomly get a hold of me like that with my schedule uh what I can do if if it helps you you have your calendar handy I can pull up mine and have you book a specific time with me that way you don't have to chase me down and vice versa would that help you and then you're going to book the the the appointment now you're like Jeremy why in the hell would you try to book an appointment why not try to overcome or find out what their real concern is I am but I first first have to do what get them to let their guard down before I try to do that okay so the point is you want them to feel like you're about to get off the phone or you're about to get off Zoom or you're about to leave their house or their their business if you sell B2B because if they feel like you're about to leave their guard comes down they don't feel like you're going to sit there and try to sell them okay so that's why you're you're wanting to book that next step appointment okay so over here on the buyboard I'm going to show you what I just did here and then I'm going to show you right after what question to ask to get them to tell you what the real concern is you want to make sure you stay here to the end this is really important now why would I say after the prospect says Hey really appreciate what you went through and and give me a couple weeks I'll get back to you if I'm interested why would I say well it might be hard to randomly get a hold of me with my schedule what does that do does that lower your status as a salesperson or does that maybe raise your status as somebody that's an expert somebody that's busy that has a lot of business happening I've got a lot of clients I don't necessarily need your business right that's the impression you come across you're not using like a weird like douche tone I don't know that's such a name but you're you're mainly using it to show that you're an expert you're an authority you've got to see if you got time to see if you'd be available for them at that point that raises your status in the prospect's mind okay you don't want it them to feel you're available 24 hours a day 7 days a week are experts really available at all times no CU they're too busy they got lots of people they're helping okay now here's where I'm going to so what I can do if you have your calendar handy I can pull up mine and have you book a specific time with me that way you don't have to chase me down in vice versa notice how I'm saying that way you don't have to chase me down in vice versa raising status I'm busy you might have to chase me down then at the end I'm saying would that help you if I did that for you now who is qualifying to who here who has the problems the prospect or you the prospect does of course you don't have the problem so why are you qualifying to them you've got to learn how to qual how to get them to qualify to you and I'm going to start showing you how to do that okay because you have the solution to solve their problem so they should be qualifying to you not the other way around I want to show you to flip that script so you don't have to chase people anymore you get to them to chase you now if they don't call you back or whatever I'll show you what to do okay now so you want them to qualify to you okay so after you do that after you've booked the appointment their guard is down they think think you're about to get off the phone get off Zoom get out of their house get out of their business wherever you sell B Toc or B2B this is the question you're asked now hey before I jump off the phone if you're on the phone or before I jump off Zoom or hey before I before I head out what was it that you were I guess wanting to go over in your mind just so I know what questions you'll have when we talk on Thursday now notice I'm not asking what was it you were unsure of that caused you to say you'll get back to me if I'm interested or what was it that you really need to think about what's preventing you from moving forward those are just kind of defensive questions that's GNA cause them to get defensive towards you this is just a better way to Rel language the same question where they don't get their guard now hey before I jump off the phone or hey before I jump off Zoom what was it that you were I guess wanting to go over in your mind just so I know what questions you'll have when we talk on Monday well Jeremy I'm just not quite sure about this or well it's just a big decision and I'm not sure we have the money for it now I know it's a money objection and now who's still there to help them overcome it you are there to help them overcome it or let me show you another way to do this okay this is just another way you can actually get the real objection now hey before I go and this is you know this is between me and you it's it's off the record I'm not going to go post it on on Facebook what's really I guess holding you back from moving forward so you're able to XYZ okay now let me analyze what I did here now before I go so they think you're about to go then you're saying this is and this is between me and you remember selling is collaborative not you against the process and this is between me and you and then you're say and it's you know off the Record now I'm not showing you the right tone here I'm just analyzing what you do here and then I'm going to rle play it again so you hear the right tone to use and then I'm going to use a playful tone here and say now I'm not going to go post this on Facebook what's really holding you back from moving forward though what's really holding you back from moving forward so you're able to and you repeat back what they said they wanted or what's really holding you back from moving forward or what's really holding you back from exploring this so that you can ABC okay there's different ways I can word this okay so let me show you the full tone here and I'm going to show you your next step now hey John before I go and this is you know it's between me and you it's it's off the record I'm not going to go post it on your IG What's um what's really holding back from moving forward so you're able to put this policy in place so when you pass sending the kids can pay off the entire mortgage if you sold life insurance see I'm just plugging in whatever they said they wanted let's say if I'm selling pools uh and this is between me and you and off the Record what's what's really holding you back from putting the pool in so you have time with your kids in the summer if that's what they said they wanted the pool for was to build memories with the kids see it doesn't matter the industry let's say if you're marketing agency what's you know this is between you and you and me and this off the record I'm not going to go post it on your social media what's really holding you back from moving forward so you can get higher quality leads to scale your company see I'm just repeating back to the end result make sense okay hope that help you today now if you want to learn more disarming
