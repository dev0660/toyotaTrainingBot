Why Should Each Customer Type Have a Detailed Tree?
✅ Mimics Real-Life Sales Conversations – No two buyers are the same. A trade-in-focused customer will react differently than a budget-conscious buyer or a luxury shopper.
✅ Forces Sales Reps to Adapt – Reps must adjust their approach based on the customer type, rather than following a generic script.
✅ Tracks Rep Performance More Accurately – AI can score reps based on how well they handled a specific buyer type.

How Should Each Customer’s Decision Tree Work?
Each customer profile should have a unique structure based on their:
1️⃣ Personality (Logical, Emotional, Impulsive, Cautious, etc.)
2️⃣ Buying Motives (Price, Features, Status, Utility, Urgency, etc.)
3️⃣ Common Objections & Pushback Patterns
4️⃣ Emotional Responses & Behavioral Shifts

Example: Customer Decision Trees
1️⃣ Budget-Conscious Buyer – Decision Tree
💡 Who They Are: Prioritizes monthly payments, interest rates, rebates, and affordability.

📞 Initial Response to the Sales Rep:

“How much is the monthly payment?” → If the rep gives a clear answer, AI stays engaged.
“That sounds too expensive.” → If the rep avoids pricing, AI fixates on cost and financing.
“I need to check my budget.” → If the rep creates urgency without pressure, AI considers moving forward.
🔀 Objection Paths:

If rep dodges price concerns → AI becomes skeptical and resistant.
If rep offers flexible financing options → AI becomes more interested.
If rep shows a long-term value comparison → AI asks about trade-ins to lower cost.
💰 Buying Signals AI Drops:

“If my trade-in covers the down payment, maybe I’d consider.”
“Can I get a lower interest rate if I put more money down?”
🔚 End of Call Possibilities:
✅ AI agrees to visit dealership if the rep proves affordability and long-term savings.
❌ AI ghosts the rep if they fail to explain pricing clearly.

2️⃣ Impulsive Buyer – Decision Tree
💡 Who They Are: Makes quick decisions based on emotion, excitement, and status.

📞 Initial Response to the Sales Rep:

“That car looks amazing!” → If the rep builds excitement, AI gets hooked.
“Tell me about the horsepower.” → If the rep focuses on performance, AI moves closer to buying.
“I love the color—do you have it in stock?” → If the rep creates urgency, AI wants to act fast.
🔀 Objection Paths:

If rep gets too technical → AI loses interest quickly.
If rep tries to slow the sale down → AI presses for immediate action.
If rep introduces exclusive incentives → AI pushes to close faster.
🔥 Buying Triggers:

“I want to be the first one to have this model.”
“I don’t want to miss out on this deal.”
🔚 End of Call Possibilities:
✅ AI agrees to an appointment if the rep keeps energy high.
❌ AI backs out later if the rep fails to confirm commitment (buyer’s remorse risk).

3️⃣ Skeptical Buyer – Decision Tree
💡 Who They Are: Doubts sales tactics, asks tough questions, resistant to persuasion.

📞 Initial Response to the Sales Rep:

“I’ve heard that before. What makes this different?” → If the rep fails to differentiate, AI dismisses the pitch.
“I don’t trust dealerships.” → If the rep acknowledges concerns & builds trust, AI engages further.
“Sounds like a gimmick.” → If the rep provides data & proof, AI softens skepticism.
🔀 Objection Paths:

If rep sounds too salesy → AI calls them out: “You’re just trying to sell me.”
If rep is vague on financing terms → AI questions transparency.
If rep provides customer success stories → AI becomes more receptive.
🔍 Trust-Building Signals AI Looks For:

“Can you show me real customer reviews?”
“How long have you worked there?”
🔚 End of Call Possibilities:
✅ AI books an appointment if the rep earns trust.
❌ AI walks away if the rep can’t answer concerns convincingly.

4️⃣ Trade-In Focused Buyer – Decision Tree
💡 Who They Are: Only interested in getting the best trade-in value.

📞 Initial Response to the Sales Rep:

“How much can you give me for my car?” → If the rep answers confidently, AI asks for a breakdown.
“CarMax offered me more.” → If the rep compares total deal value, AI considers staying.
“I think I can sell it for more myself.” → If the rep explains trade-in tax savings, AI engages further.
🔀 Objection Paths:

If rep lowballs trade-in → AI pushes back & threatens to go elsewhere.
If rep explains total cost of ownership → AI becomes open to negotiation.
If rep gives a “today only” trade-in bonus → AI asks for an appointment.
🚗 Motivation Clues AI Gives:

“If I don’t get at least $8,000, I’m not trading.”
“I just don’t want to deal with private selling.”
🔚 End of Call Possibilities:
✅ AI books an appointment if the rep convinces them of a fair trade-in deal.
❌ AI leaves if the rep doesn’t offer a competitive valuation.

How This Improves AI Training:
✅ Every customer type has a unique decision tree, making calls feel realistic.
✅ Reps must learn how to identify customer priorities and adapt quickly.
✅ AI tracks rep performance based on how well they navigate different buyer types.
✅ AI can gradually increase difficulty based on the rep’s success rate.
