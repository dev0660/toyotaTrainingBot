Overcoming Used Car Sales Objections
March 1, 2019Used Car Tips


It’s a scenario that used car sales reps know all too well: You’ve just spent several minutes talking with a potential buyer, only to have them say they need to go home and think about their decision rather than signing on the dotted line right then and there.
This happens all the time, but it can still be frustrating. In this post, we’ll provide some positive and strategic ways to respond to sales objections.
When the Buyer is Ready to Walk
Acknowledge the objection—but with a positive spin
The first thing you need to do is simply acknowledge the rejection. It’s critical to mentally prepare yourself in advance so that you can maintain a smile and proper composure; if you allow yourself to look defeated, you’ve probably lost your opportunity.
Always repeat back the customer’s objection, letting them know you really heard them—but put a positive spin on it. For example, say something like: “I’m glad you want to take the time to think things through, and to make a really informed decision. That’s what I want for you, too.”
Let the buyer know that he/she is not alone
Next, tell a quick story. It can be a personal story or a story of one of your customers. And it doesn’t have to be long—a sentence or two is often sufficient.
The point is to let the buyer know that he or she is not the only one who wants to take things slow and think things over. So just tell them about another customer who wanted to take some time to contemplate their vehicle purchase. Show some empathy for where your buyer is coming from.
Get to the root of the problem
The next step is to ease into the underlying problem—not by asking point-blank questions, but simply by giving the buyer a chance to reveal what’s really holding them back.
Use a variant of this script: “You know, Rob, something I’ve found is that customers usually have one of three major concerns—concern about price, about the reputation of the dealership, or about the skill level of the sales rep. Of course, I want to make sure I’m helping you as best I can, so may I ask what’s keeping you from making your decision right now?”
Score some yeses
If your customer opens up to you about the root problem, the next step is to get them back on the same page as you—something you can do by asking some simple questions that will get the buyer saying yes.
Examples:
Pricing is a really common hindrance; you obviously want to get the best value possible, right?
It would be ideal if I could help you drive off the lot in a new vehicle today, right?
Address the Issue
Now you’re ready to do anything you can to address the underlying issue—whether that means coming down off the price, talking with the customer about your dealership’s reputation, or even calling a manager for some back-up. Hopefully, these efforts can turn indecision into a definite yes.

Types of Sales Objections
Sales objections can be grouped into several common type:
Price objections happen when prospects feel your product is too expensive. They might say, “This costs too much,” or “I can’t afford it.”
Need objections occur when prospects don’t see the need for your product. They might respond with, “I don’t think I need this,” or “We are happy with what we have.”
Timing objections arise when prospects say it’s not the right time to purchase. You might hear, “Can we revisit this in a few months?” or “I’m too busy right now.”
Trust objections happen when prospects are not sure they can trust your company or product. They could say, “I haven’t heard of your company before,” or “How do I know this will work?”
The Psychology Behind Objections
Understanding why people object helps you address their concerns better. Prospects usually have fears or doubts about spending money, wasting time, or making a wrong decision. They worry about taking risks, especially with something unfamiliar. Price objections, for instance, often stem from a fear of wasting money. Need objections might come from a place of feeling secure with what they already have. When prospects raise a trust objection, it often means they need more information or reassurance. By providing more details and building a relationship, you can help reduce their worries.
Strategies for Handling Objections
Building Value Over Price
Price objections are common in sales. Shifting the conversation from price to the value your product offers can make a big difference. For example, if a customer says, “This is too expensive,” respond by highlighting specific benefits and features that make your product worth the cost.
Example: “I understand that the price may seem high, but consider the time you’ll save with our software’s automated reporting feature.”
Example: “Think about the long-term savings. Our product has a lifespan of 10 years, which reduces the need for frequent replacements.”
Example: “Our product includes premium customer support, which ensures any issue you face will be quickly resolved at no extra cost.”
Example: “Using our product has been shown to increase productivity by 25%, giving you a greater return on your investment.”
Example: “While this may cost more upfront, the additional features can lead to higher revenue for your business.”
Template:
“I understand [objection]. Is there a specific feature or benefit you feel is missing?”
Template:
“When you consider [benefit], do you see how the value aligns with the price?”
Addressing Budget Concerns
Too Expensive: “I understand budget is crucial. Many customers find our product pays for itself in savings. Can we explore a smaller package or payment plan?”
No Budget Allocation: “Can we discuss next quarter’s budget? Alternatively, are there other departments that could share the cost?”
Better Offer from Competitor: “Competitors may look cheaper. Let’s compare actual benefits and long-term savings from our product.”
Not the Right Time: “We can lock in current pricing now and start when the budget allows. Does that help?”
Need to Check Finances: “Would a detailed return on investment analysis help in getting approval?”
Template: “I understand [specific concern]. Many clients initially worried about cost found [specific advantage] to be a huge value. How about [suggestion]?”
Emphasizing Solutions and ROI
Customers want to know that your product will solve their problems and provide a good return on investment. When faced with objections, focus on how your product addresses their specific needs.
Example: “Our product reduces downtime by 50%, ensuring your operations run smoothly.”
Example: “With our solution, you can streamline your processes, which has led to a 20% increase in efficiency for other clients.”
Example: “We’ve designed our product to solve the exact issues you’re experiencing, such as [specific problem].”
Example: “Investing in our product means fewer maintenance fees, saving you money in the long run.”
Example: “Our clients have seen a significant ROI within the first six months of using our product.”

Using Social Proof to Your Advantage
Social proof, like testimonials and case studies, can be powerful in overcoming objections. Customers feel more confident when they see others have had positive experiences with your product.
Example: “Our client, [Company Name], saw a 30% boost in their sales after using our product.”
Example: “Read what [Customer Name] had to say about how our product helped their business grow.”
Example: “Check out our case study on [Company Name], who faced similar challenges and achieved great results.”
Example: “We have over 500 satisfied customers who have left positive reviews on our site.”
Example: “Our product has been rated 4.8 stars by independent review sites.”

“Many businesses like yours have seen [specific result] with our product.”
Template:
“Would you like to see a case study from another customer who faced similar challenges?”
Navigating Contracts and Authority Issues
Sometimes, customers feel they can’t commit due to contract terms or lack of authority. Address these concerns by providing solutions and reassurance.
Locked into a Contract: “We can work with you despite your current contract. Can we discuss how our services could be complementary?”
Need Higher Approval: “Would setting up a joint meeting with the decision-maker help? I can provide a detailed proposal tailored to your needs.”
Not Authorized to Sign Off: “How about we draft a proposal together, so you can present it with all the needed information?”
Contract Terms Too Restrictive: “We’re open to discussing flexible contract terms. What specific terms are you worried about?”
Concerned About Long Commitment: “We offer shorter-term trial options for new clients. Would a 3-month trial be helpful?”
Template: “I understand [specific concern]. Many clients successfully navigated this by [solution]. Could we try [suggestion]?”
Handling Product or Services Doubts
Customers often hesitate due to doubts about your product or service. Address these doubts with clear and specific information.

Doubt About Results: “Here are case studies showing how our product has helped others. Would you like to review them?”
Think It’s Not Needed: “Others in your field found that our solution resolved [specific problem they faced]. Could we explore if you have similar needs?”
Quality Concerns: “We follow strict quality checks. Would a product demo ease your concerns?”

Tailoring Your Pitch to the Prospect
Customizing Responses to Industry Needs

Advanced Objection Handling Techniques
Creating a Sense of Urgency
Creating urgency influences potential customers to act promptly. Timing is crucial. Highlight deadlines, limited availability, or special offers. Mentioning that a price increase is coming soon or that only a few items remain in stock can motivate action.
“This offer is only available until Friday. After that, prices go up.”
“We’re running low on inventory, and once it’s gone, it could be months before we restock.”
“Our promotion ends tomorrow. Securing the deal today guarantees you the best rate.”
“We have a limited-time bundle offer that expires at the end of the month.”
“If you sign up now, you can take advantage of our current pricing before our rates increase.”
Template:
“We currently have only [number] units available. If you decide today, you can secure your purchase before we run out.”

“You mentioned that integrating this software could be tricky. Let’s discuss how our team assists with implementation.”
“I hear you’re worried about budget constraints. Can we explore a tiered payment plan to ease the cost?”
“The compatibility with your current system seems to be an issue. Let’s arrange a tech call to ensure a smooth integration.”
“Too many features feel overwhelming? Let’s prioritize the ones that meet your immediate needs.”
Template:
“To address [specific concern], could we set up a meeting with your team to discuss detailed requirements?”
Template:
“Considering your concern about [specific issue], let’s look into a step-by-step approach to resolve it.”
