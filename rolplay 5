What is a sales role-play?


Larry J.B. Robinson wrote about it in his article "Role Playing as a Sales Training Tool" in 1987, however the term itself appeared long time before that.
To make it simple you can picture sales role-play as a super chill yet effective way to turn your sales team into absolute deal-sealing masters.
It's like a practice arena where reps duke it out in genuine selling situations, sharpening their skills and tackling the unexpected situations they'll come across in real-life sales meetings.
In sales role-play exercises, reps get the chance to ask questions, test strategies, and uncover game-changing insights in a safe zone. This helps you achieve the goals from the recent sales planning.
This is how such an immersive training style amps up confidence and equips reps to handle a full spectrum of customer interactions.
‍
But what's the secret sauce that makes role-play exercises the GOAT of sales training?
When reps step into the shoes of various customer types, they learn to adapt their sales technique and communication style to each unique person, case, or scenario. This deep dive into the minds of their target audience turns reps into customer whisperers, ready to address diverse needs and nail those sales conversations.
‍
By implementing sales role-plays into your training process, sales reps can sharpen their skills to:
Lock onto and connect with different customer profiles
Whip up custom sales pitches that really resonate with each persona
Tackle objections or concerns unique to each customer type
Forge connections and build trust from diverse types of potential clients
Now is the time to jump straight into 12 sales role-play scenarios we prepared to challenge your sales rep's objection-handling skills, negotiation prowess, and creativity.
