Cold Call Decision Tree â€“ AI Simulated Customer Types
Customer Type 1: Skeptical Customer
(AI is doubtful and questions everything.)

Branch 1: AI Expresses Doubt Immediately ("Sounds too good to be true.")
If the salesperson provides strong proof (case study, data, social proof):
AI softens: "Okay, but how do I know this will work for my business?" â†’ Go to Branch 2.
If the salesperson provides vague or weak proof:
AI remains skeptical: "Thatâ€™s not convincing. Iâ€™ve heard that before." â†’ Go to Branch 3.
Branch 2: AI Needs Personal Relevance ("How do I know this will work for me?")
If the salesperson customizes the response to AIâ€™s business:
AI moves to curiosity: "Interesting. How does that actually work?" â†’ Go to Branch 4.
If the salesperson gives a generic response:
AI disengages: "I doubt this applies to us." (Call ends.)
Branch 3: AI Pushes Back Hard ("Iâ€™ve heard this before.")
If the salesperson acknowledges skepticism & offers a risk-free way to verify claims:
AI considers: "A free trial? Maybe, send details." â†’ Go to follow-up.
If the salesperson tries to push forward without addressing doubts:
AI shuts down: "Yeah, I donâ€™t buy it." (Call ends.)
Branch 4: AI Becomes Curious ("How does this actually work?")
If the salesperson explains in a clear, concise, and compelling way:
AI moves to a call/demo: "Okay, Iâ€™ll hear you out." (Call scheduled.)
If the salesperson over-explains or sounds unsure:
AI loses patience: "Too complicated. Not for us." (Call ends.)
Customer Type 2: Price-Focused Customer
(AI objects based on cost concerns.)

Branch 1: AI Immediately Brings Up Cost ("This sounds expensive.")
If the salesperson focuses on ROI (value vs. cost):
AI asks for specifics: "Okay, what kind of return are we talking about?" â†’ Go to Branch 2.
If the salesperson justifies price without showing value:
AI remains skeptical: "Still sounds pricey." â†’ Go to Branch 3.
Branch 2: AI Asks for ROI Details ("What kind of return?")
If the salesperson shares a measurable ROI (case studies, savings, efficiency):
AI considers: "Alright, maybe. How do payments work?" (Price negotiation.)
If the salesperson struggles to show ROI:
AI declines: "Doesnâ€™t sound worth it." (Call ends.)
Branch 3: AI Pushes for a Discount ("Can you lower the price?")
If the salesperson offers flexible payment plans or additional value instead of lowering price:
AI responds: "Okay, maybe Iâ€™ll look at options." (Follow-up scheduled.)
If the salesperson immediately offers a discount:
AI doubts credibility: "So your original price was inflated?" (Loses trust, ends call.)
Customer Type 3: Competitor-Loyal Customer
(AI already uses a competitor and is reluctant to switch.)

Branch 1: AI States They Use a Competitor ("We already use [Competitor X].")
If the salesperson acknowledges and asks for a satisfaction rating:
AI shares mild dissatisfaction: "Weâ€™re okay with them, I guess." â†’ Go to Branch 2.
If the salesperson dismisses the competitor without engaging:
AI gets defensive: "Weâ€™re happy with them, thanks." (Call ends.)
Branch 2: AI Shows Mild Dissatisfaction ("Weâ€™re okay with them.")
If the salesperson asks what could make their solution better:
AI reveals pain points: "Well, their customer service is slow." â†’ Go to Branch 3.
If the salesperson immediately pitches instead of uncovering needs:
AI resists: "Weâ€™re not looking to switch." (Call ends.)
Branch 3: AI Shares a Competitor Weakness ("Their service is slow.")
If the salesperson explains how their company solves that problem:
AI considers: "Thatâ€™s interesting. Tell me more." (Call/demo scheduled.)
If the salesperson doesnâ€™t address the concern well:
AI remains neutral: "Still not worth switching." (Call ends.)
Training Summary
Skeptical Customer â†’ Tests the salespersonâ€™s ability to handle doubt and objections using proof, personalization, and trust-building.
Price-Focused Customer â†’ Forces the salesperson to justify cost through value and ROI rather than just discounting.
Competitor-Loyal Customer â†’ Ensures the salesperson uncovers pain points and differentiates effectively rather than just dismissing competitors.
Each type pushes sales reps to refine their response strategies, objection handling, and ability to build trust and curiosity. Would you like additional variations, such as a highly interested but cautious buyer or a customer with budget approval constraints? ðŸš€
