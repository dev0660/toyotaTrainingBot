I'm going to set an appointment with them okay and I'm going to show you how to do we're going to call it phase one phase two phase three so let's choose a kind of list that we're going to call so are we going to call customers out of the service department that you know spent uh $1,000 or more on their tickets and we're going to call them and try to get these people to come in and trade their cars in because you know they have a monthly payment plus they spent money out of their pocket are we going to call people that have been in the service department are we going to call customers that you know enter in credit applications or Internet leads or phone calls and they didn't buy we could call all these people but I want to make this video about orphan owners what is an orphan owner to me to me personally and I know what it is to you an orphan owner is when there's a customer and the salesman no longer works there that's an orphan owner because they don't have an owner which is the salesperson anymore because they don't work there I think what an orphan owner is to me is a customer who is no longer getting called by a salesperson anymore and that means that they're there they bought from the dealership they trust the dealership but nobody's calling them so that's an orphan owner to me hey guys what's going on it's Andy a lot of you leave comments tell me that you need help

what your car was worth would you mind if I told you how much that was can I tell you he'll say uh no Andy I think I'm good right now hey no problem real quick before we get off the phone by the way I appreciate you being a valued customer if your house was worth $100,000 but someone was going to give you 500 Grand wouldn't you give them two minutes of your time just two minutes yeah I'd probably give him two minutes cool that's all I need is Mr Johnson is 2 minutes of your time look if you had a winning lottery ticket in your pocket would you want to know how much it was for I bet you would listen that's what's going on right now basically our owner has been writing over you know hundreds of thousands of dollars of equity checks overpaying for people's cars this last month he's getting so crazy we're about to put him in a straight jacket so this is how this works you come down here literally two minutes I'm gonna give you a crazy offer blow your mind and in the end it's your decision does that sound fair can you give me two minutes it doesn't matter if it's today or tomorrow all I need you to do is come by I'm going to blow your mind if he says I'm not interested you say have a blessed day call the next customer if he says I'll be there tomorrow say awesome what time tomorrow also I'm going to take a picture of me and I'll send it to you so you know who I am put a name with the face when you come in I'm going to text you my address to the dealership so that way when you when you just get ready to head this way you can press the button and the map will take you

in for what do you have now and just choose that vehicle does that make sense okay now once you're done with that phase three is that my general manager write this down my general manager wanted me to personally reach out and ask you one question if you still had that vehicle would you do if he was willing to offer you write this down if he was willing to offer you more money now notice I said more

could tell me and I say awesome ready awesome write that down awesome let me tell you how this works that's how easy it is awesome let me tell you how this works my owner my general manager already already wrote hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity checks overpaying my general manager wrote hundreds of thousands of dollars of checks overpaying for people's trade-ins it's that simple that we're just like yours he's getting so crazy we're about to put him in a straight jacket ha ha ha you're going to laugh and then you're going to say so can you make it in right now or would afterward be best what's best for you it's only going to take about 2 minutes now if they say oh well can't you tell me on the phone say no actually we can't tell you on the phone my general manager he's going to be here when you get here he's going to check out your vehicle and then he's going to blow your mind with an offer by the way everybody write this down by the way if you had a winning lottery ticket in your pocket wouldn't you want to know how much it was worth absolutely don't make them answer you answer you say absolutely so here's what I need you to do I need you to come down it's going to take about two minutes I'm going to blow your mind and in the end it's your decision I promise you this is going to this is going to your mind that's it now this system right here is made to generate appointments okay instead of sitting on your butt like a fisherman waiting for something to bite as a car salesman in your dealership you're going to be like a lion now hunting okay and you were on your phone and you were dialing got a non-negotiable when I sold it was make A1 to2 200 di a day you choose or sell one or two cars okay my deal is I made 200 dials a day or sold three cars but you can choose you're either going to make x amount of dials or sell x amount of cars by the way that's called a non-negotiable which means it's not for negotiation you feel me okay now can you see us setting some appointments yes you can I know you can and can you memorize this and can you say it easy and can you say it well and can you do a good job yes I'm going to show you how to sell an additional 10 15 20 cars a month by using this only though if you can get them to say yes I want to buy something when they get there you ready for that okay so it goes like this so the client shows up you're going to say hey Mr Johnson what's going on it's Andy ellot I spoke to you on the phone by the way it means everything to me that you came down come on inside by the way what can I get you to drink something hot or cold to drink what would you like get them something to drink have them have a seat when they sit down say awesome so Mr Johnson I'm going to go get some information off your vehicle I'm going to give it to my GM I'm going to blow your mind okay by the way don't go drink coffee now and hang out with your buddies go shoot out to the car go get all the information off the car check out the vehicle look at all of it does does it have dip spit on the floor is the dash lit up like a Christmas tree are the tires bald does it look like they're taken great care of and it's in awesome shape right like take a look at it like consciously pay attention you're going to get all the information off of it now are you going to go get your manager no you don't need your manager you need to listen to me and I'm going to show you what to do you're going to walk into the manager sales Tower and you're going to ditch those keys out of your hand get them out of your hand get those keys gone now once the keys are gone what do I got in my hand I got a trade appraisal I ditch the keys and I'm going to go back over to Mr Johnson I'm going say hey Mr Johnson remember I talked to you I said remember Tom my general manager who's going to go check out your vehicle he's about to go drive it right now hypothetically write that down hypothetically I want to ask you a question if my general manager Tom came over here and made you a crazy offer Mr Johnson and you were like you know what get your checkbook out cuz I'm selling it let's say you said that to me right well what would you drive home in would it be something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage more warranty what would it be smile and be quiet what did I say newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas smileage more warranty what would it be be quiet they'll say it'd be something bigger boom baby must be your birthday cuz Big Daddy's got something bigger I want to show you let's roll I'm going to just go outside and go sell them a car what would it be would be something um you know newer okay when you say newer you mean brand new or just maybe a couple years up newer probably a couple years up near okay cool Max miles you want to go with maybe 50,000 or under what are you thinking yeah 50,000 or under now listen we stay with the same kind of body style you got now or would you be open to change as long as it has enough room kind of like what you got now I don't know it just has to be a Ford or a Chevy okay you know what is it your birthday today cuz I got a birthday present for you come on man hey you must have a magic RIT foot in your pocket cuz it's your lucky day let's go that's it I'm going to tell you how this plays out people always want to spend money they do they they're addicted to it okay they're sitting in their house they're sitting at work people love upgrading cars they love trading them in and people love spending money so that's where you become important you just got to become a professional now when you get them into the dealership do you think on the way into the dealership they thought what if this guy gives me a lot of money what would I do would I trade it in yeah because they don't need two cars and they can't walk home so they're going to trade it in so guess what they've already thought about it and manifested doing something if you if you did give them the right number now did we even give them a number yet no because it doesn't really matter because I know your managers and your GMS and your owners are going to fight like crazy to make sure they buy this tradeing off these people and give them enough money you feel me trust me as much as it costs right now to acquire a trade in right or to go to an auction and buy one and then recondition it and pay the auction fees and then also you know like have it delivered to your company which is called shipping like it's a lot of money so right now managers are trying their best to require trade-ins that are sitting in front of their face which you've just done and by the way is this client in front of you did you ask to write questions and by the way let's say my general manager came in hypothetically made you a crazy offer and you were like you know what get your checkbook out cuz I'm selling it let's say you said that right what would you drive home in something newer bigger smaller lower miles better gas mileage more warranty what would it be you guys get it now listen one of the reasons why when I sold I averaged 70 to 80 cars a month consistently I knew how to work my service Drive okay I I knew how to make outbound calls and I knew how to take inbound calls these things are what made me dangerous simple okay being deadly on the service Drive taking inbound calls and making outbound calls and by the way most the people that were living and dying by the gate they average 15 cars a month at best and here I am average 70 to 80 if you want to be the best in the world you're going to have to learn to do things that most normal salespeople can't do and I just taught it to you by the way if you feel like you've got value from this video do
