[Music] there is something that always works to get report and it's something called matching and mirroring the person who pointed out was Milton Erikson he understood that you have both a conscious mind and a subconscious mind and he knew the subconscious is more powerful it's the make part that makes your heartbeat a 100 thousand times a day without having to think about it and he began to notice something about human beings that when human beings got together if they got in Rapport a relationship over responsiveness they became like each other in a variety of ways what he called they mirrored each other but here's the basis of it people like people who are like whom themselves and people don't like people who are not like themselves to be more specific write this down people like people who are like themselves or who are like how they would like to be now if you want to be effective then mirroring is so easy we do it naturally but here's the problem most people wait till they have enough words in common that then they put the voice in common and the body in common but words are only 7% they don't work all the time breathing breathing is very powerful one of the most powerful if you breathe at the exact same Pace as another person you will feel what they are feeling period but you got to breathing from the same location the same tempo and breathing is magnificent because it really hooks you to this person you don't have to mirror everything someone does to have Rapport it's not like they lift their leg you lift your leg they lean forward you lean forward they sit back then you sit back you don't have to do that although believe it or not you can do it a lot and people not even notice but for example you can get Rapport just with a leg position and maybe the tone of voice because physiology is 55% of communication if you're sitting there let's say let's say you cross your leg like this can I cross my leg like this while we're talking yes or no it'll feel comfortable to you so you start bouncing your foot like this back and forth can I bounce my foot at the same tempo if I do you'll feel totally connected to [Music] me
