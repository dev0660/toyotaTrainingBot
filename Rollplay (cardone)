Uncle Jesse come on man I often would you consider role-playing how often would you own recommend it recommend what role role playing the script every day I recommend role-playing every day it's worth doing if it's worth doing one day it's worth doing every day and how long would you recommend doing with the team life 15 minutes yeah yeah like we're Steve spray where's the guys they do the role-playing who wants to do this chair okay let's do a little roleplay Jared who you who did want to use here here you get role role played the clothes you would come up here guys come up here Steve spray mr. Steve spray farm boy and Dave Dave come on Dave Security trustees okay you guys just want to talk about you got want to talk about um what one what you've learnt how long you've been there day for your four and a half years if not pleasure how long Steve buddies so what did you learn about being there really just everything he talks about where what people are really thinking you know like when he told me that there's only four things people object to price time stall and product but the first thing I was covering up the last one I was like oh dude it's always the product yeah so they don't believe something and to ask the hard questions hey what do you not believe about what we're doing and it changed everything yeah and he does a great job Dave does a great job the role playing in the training that's the success meetings we have every day how does that help you most stay focused and and how is it contributed to your production first off it's stable I know it's happening every day every day at 8:40 from 8:40 to 9 o'clock that's exactly what we're gonna do every day I'm for me I got to the point where I get to help the new guys which helps sharpen me uh-huh so the stable thing there's no question on this is exactly what we're doing every single day and they're doing role playing at what time every day 8:42 for yeah so to answer your question how long they're doing about 24 minutes every day so do y'all want to show them how that works like we didn't plan this today said Saturday what would so obvious hey Steve what are you working on today we went down are you standing up either one we just sit down stand up I mean yeah you know sit down face to face I mean we roleplay with each other I mean David Steve grant cardones office how you doing this morning hey man what's up hey listen grant would we reach out and give you access to the number-one sales training program in the world you got two minutes so yeah I'm not gonna be interested in there I knew you were before I called you but I wanted to get you access to it so that way you could use it before we talked you got a couple minutes I could just give you access I'd say what call me back in two weeks done I'll call you back in two weeks but if you give me 30 seconds I want you to know what I'm gonna call you back about jumping from a computer go-to card on university comm I don't have time right now I know you don't you got 15 seconds okay good go to court on University comp and say I'm not hit not in it's about is a to him I'm not coming up with stuff I'm it's something I make it a real call it's actually what we hear on the car I'm busy call me back I'm not interested and then that's out of the way and it gets me to where I want to go so now he's got that out of the way he's had his first guy tell him what I'm not interested what's he preparing for today right what's the thing I'll say about rusty how long does it take to get rust one day sometimes 12 hours yeah sometimes three hours so you got you got a sales team exactly you got a sales team coming back from a vacation after three days can't even find himself for a day and a half can't find her stuff that doesn't you get on the phone you call somebody I'm not interested oh god I hate this job he got he got this handled already 840 okay now we're gonna flip it and have Steve do it the other way cuz that go ahead can I say one thing about this so with the roleplay it got me to like be in the position to understand what's going on so when Grant tells me that it's all made up and I'm like okay good and then I get on the phone with somebody who says I don't have time right now and grant tells me that it's all made up and I'm like we don't have time for what man you pick up the phone think about it he would have time if it was the right thing the same executive that says they didn't have time it's going to go to the gym at 2:00 o'clock and workout like you guys don't think that these people are so busy that they don't have time right I don't care who it is everybody makes time for things they want to do they don't have time for people they don't know never heard of want to be want to sell them something they don't have time right so what they're gonna do now is they're gonna flip this so Dave's gonna make the sale and he becomes the customer and by the way you can learn as much from being a customer as being the salesperson dangling hey Steve Dave here grant cardones office what's happening not much man what's happening I'll be real quick if they grant Ashley he asked me to reach out to you he's got a tool he created that increases sales by 40% in the first 60 days he wanted me to give you some access to it you have two minutes yeah now right now Dave but we're all good yeah I knew you were good before I called you man we only do business with people that are good I tell you what give me 30 seconds if you don't like what you see in the first 30 seconds I'll hang up on myself well why don't you just email me something maybe we'll take a look next done what's your email Steve that Grant Cardone com I'm gonna send that right over to you now what do I need to put in there that would actually get your attention what are your people are working on right now well I mean we're always working on everything yeah man everybody's working on everything but if there was one thing right now that just gives you a headache with your sales team what would it be I follow up man why do you say follow up they don't do it how much what do you think that's costing you every month I don't know you got 10 sales guys you you think each one of them misses one deal a month because they're not following up yeah probably it's one what's one deal worth to a customer to your company $30,000 man that's $300,000 a month that you're missing out on cuz you follow ups not there that's over three million dollars a year do I have your attention but but you guys gotta understand Dave couldn't even multiply when he came like defective Dave got the first three hundred ran out I was shocked that was like that damn Dave just multiply I knew he was gonna take it out twelve months I'm gonna in no way okay okay so look give these guys a big hand huh good job guys [Music]
