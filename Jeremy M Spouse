Jeremy Miner founder of 7th level in today's training I'm going to show you how to prevent the spouse objection from happening in your prospect's mind I'm going to show you several pre-f framing techniques that you can use early in your conversations that actually cause the prospect not to even think about I want to talk to my spouse by the end of that conversation come over the vibe board I'm going to show some great road tracks today we are live here so every Tuesday we have a Facebook live where we go live here on my desktop and we also go live here on the IG phone sometimes I'll even go live on Tik Tok not as much so we're going live here in our Facebook group sales Revolution 145,000 plus of you run around in that Facebook group and we're also going live right now here on the IG phone I call it the bat phone there's 740 some thousand of you chasing me around here on the bat phone and every week we go through a different uh subject okay now this week we are going to to cover the dreaded spouse objection we're going to do it a little bit differently okay because I want to know by typing have you type in me okay I want you to to find out I want you to tell me type in me in the chat if you'd like to learn how to prevent that objection from even happening in the prospect's mind so in the chats if you're here on Zoom here in the Facebook group type in me if you're in uh okay can you guys hear the sound you guys should be able to hear me here you guys should be able to hear me let me know if you uh can hear me type in yes if you can hear me type in yes if you can hear me because there's a few of you that says there's no sound there's no sound okay okay so you guys can hear me right okay so how many of you want to learn how to prevent that objection from happening because what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you some pref framing techniques okay that can drastically reduce the prospects that actually give you this objection okay and I'm going to show you a generic version so you can plug in your industry and then I picked about five or six different random Industries okay and I'm going to show you industry specific examples so you can see how that structure works and be able to tie that into your industry okay now it's a little bit different than let's say I need to talk to the board if you sell B2B or I need to talk to my department there's a few angles I will save that training for a different time this is mainly the spouse objection now if you're brand new to the Facebook group sales Revolution let's say you just joined that sucker or you just started following me on IG I'm Jeremy Miner I'm the founder of seventh level seventh level if you don't know by now is a sales training organization that trains salese like you so we train salese like you we train service providers like you even people like plumbers that need to get new clients we train coaches like you Consultants like you business owners like you cons uh

smash the heart button button and I want you to smash the like button okay so I want you to smash the heart button smash the like button I better see hundreds between this Facebook group here and RD we've got several hundred of you on here between both of those platforms so smash the heart button smash the like button okay yes and we do train companies that sell water believe it or not not underwater basket weaving though okay now how do we train you guys all right so if you're a client you already know this because you're already going through our virtual training programs or Group Training calls as clients if you're not a client I'm just going to show you sneak peeks here and there okay probably want to become a client if you want to learn how to sell a lot more than you are now so how do we do that it's a technique called neq that stands for neuro emotional persuasion questioning that comes from my background in Behavioral Science and human psychology in University and after not only we're going to teach you the right questions to ask but we're going to teach you more importantly how to ask them because it's not the question s well that's part of it but it's really how you ask them because your tone is how the prospect interprets your intention behind everything you say and everything you ask your tonality matters because a lot of you are using the same script your company provides why is a top salesperson out selling you three or four to one when you're saying the same things it's because they're how they're saying it okay we're going to talk a little bit about that today all right now let's come over to the board and I'm going to put you guys on IG I'm going to put you a little bit over here so maybe you can see that by board a little bit better behind me I'm going to try to position it as best as I can so you can see most of it it's hard to do all this stuff with the lighting but I will do my best even though the lighting's up on the ceilings now I'll do my best so you can see everything and I'll probably try to put this a little bit here for you guys okay perfect all right now let's talk about this because there are two ways to do this let me move this here yeah better better better okay so how do you prevent this from happening let's talk about this first so there's two things how can we preframe so WR write this down this is called any PQ pre framing okay little to the left Jackie says little to the left I'm going to try to get to the left here for you I got to keep everybody on my desktop happy in the Facebook group so I'll do my best that light's just going to have to deal with it here with what we've got these Lighting on the ceing all right so how can you preframe to prevent the objection from happening in their mind now I want to ask you does the prospect wake up in the morning before you call them before you meet them in person or virtually before you knock on the door depending on your industry and do they plan out you know what I think at the end of the sales conversation I think I'm going to tell that salesperson that I need to talk with my spouse or I need to think it over but I need to do more research do they plan out objections no objections are triggered in your prospect's mind because of uncertainty now who controls that the prospect has certainty about their problems and what you offer or has uncertainty about their problems and how you can solve them you control that the salesperson you can quite literally reframe the prospect's way of thinking once you learn how to do it and how to use the tone they can quite literally take them from a prospect that hates your guts in 2 seconds to being your best friend 12 minutes later and wanting to buy everything you have you just have to learn how to do it it's a skill that you have to acquire it's not something you're born with let me know if anybody type in me if you were born out of your mother's womb with Advanced questioning skills type in me if you were born out of your mother's womb with Advanced questioning skills nobody right type in me if you were born born with Advanced tonality skills nobody right type in me if you were born with Advanced objection handling and prevention skills nobody well according to Duke Duke says he was born with Advanced question skills Advanced tonality skills and advanced objection prevention skills Duke you're born with pre-f framing skills that is amazing I love that I love that Duke I'm just giving you a hard time there on IG all right now if we do get the objection how do we help them overcome it themselves what is more effective you throwing out a rebuttal and proving that you're right and they're wrong or helping the prospect overcome the concern themselves I can tell you which one's going to make you 10 times the sales you're making now okay all right now let's keep going at no no bad words here Jack this is a good place don't don't use bad words words here all right now let's give you a few examples I'm going to show you some pref framing examples first okay now here's a generic example first so write this s this is generic I'm going to give you the formula okay so let's say I'm in my situation questions part of my conversation uh we call those neq situation questions I'm helping the prospect understand what their real situation is and not only that I'm helping myself understand what their real situation is cuz most prospects don't really know hey Jeremy miss working with you Daniel Filler Daniel get into the training courses got options for you now for for uh renewals that are like 75% less get in there the different training programs okay so I might lean and say oh how does your spouse feel about how does your spouse feel about and I could repeat back maybe a problem so I could repeat oh how does your let's say if you're a Network marketer how does your spouse feel about you having to commute an hour each way to from work let's say if you sold uh I don't know uh like you're a personal trainer and you're trying you're selling Fitness so how did your spouse feel about the kind of that weight that you've you've you've gained the last few years or how does your spouse feel about you losing the 106 pounds see I can also repeat back the end result okay ah yeah how does your how does your spouse feel about you getting I guess uh you know more lead so you can really grow your real estate okay it does doesn't matter see I'm just repeating back how does your spouse feel about either the end result of what you sell or the main problem okay I can do one or the other sometimes it depends on the industry you're in okay use a pest control example you should already know that but I just told you Pest Control is a huge industry train how does your how does your spouse feel about the all the brown recluses like nesting and breeding in the closets though see there you go that's a problem problem see how easy that is how did your spouse feel about all the Ant-Man out here like running around the kids out in the yard see same thing doesn't matter okay same thing all right now I'm going to show you a few different industry specific examples type in me if you're in the fitness or weight loss industry that's a huge industry we train we train thousands in this space so let's say that I'm talking with Dan and Dan says he wants to lose 108 lbs and I get him to open up because I understand how to clarify him probe with my tone to get him to open up emotionally about why losing 108 lbs is so important to him now not just losing the weight it's what's behind the why okay so then he says the reason why he wants to lose that weight is because he feels like when his daughter grows up in 15 years and let's say gets married he might not be around to walk her down the aisle you probably want to clarify and probe why that's so important to him though to be there for her to walk her down the aisle don't just go off oh you want to walk your daughter down theis that's great let me show you how so being there for your daughter why why is it so important you John concern tone Oh gosh because you know my dad wasn't you know there for my sister cuz he died early cuz he was overweight see I'm helping him relive the emotional pain okay see what I'm doing there okay hello sounds so funny to ask but my company's been using NB training courses all year and I saw it works well that's typically why salespeople and companies come to us we have we don't ever have companies or salesp people that come to us and want to be clients because they want to learn how to sell less they always say they want to what learn how to sell more right perfect good for you tell me what training courses they're in we have 37 different training courses in our programs and and group coaching and all that stuff so tell me which one they're in that would be awesome okay now same thing here okay so how do how did your spouse feel about losing the 108 PB so you're able to be there for your daughter to really walk her down the aisle now if it's something really personal I'm going to use like weight loss and gain that's a pretty personal touchy subject especially if you're talking to a woman that's maybe really overweight now some men it's still person personal but just it's not as touchy okay so you got to understand who you're talking to okay with what type of tone you're using all right so how did your spouse feel about you losing the 108 lbs so you're really able to walk you're down the aisle in 10 to 15 years concern tone okay remember your tone is how the prospect interprets your intention behind everything you say and ask right does that make sense everybody here on my desktop on Facebook with the Facebook group IG I got you IG phone over here so I'm going to look back and forth because I'm going live in our Facebook group here sales Revolution as well now let me give you another example let's say if you sell life insurance this is the biggest industry in the world we train we train hundreds of thousands in this space okay same exact thing here look at what I'm doing here I'm going to try to minimize this for you guys on IG so you can see it a little bit better okay now here's what I can do I can repeat back either the problem or the end result now this is all pre-f framing I'm not asking this at the very end if they give me a spouse objection I'm all pre-framed all this right now okay I want to see how you're doing this so how dides your how does your spouse feel about having the coverage so that she can pay off the the house and and the cars and the credit cards when you pass away so she doesn't have to get a second job so let's say if I'm talking to a male it doesn't matter or if I'm talking to the wife let's say I'm just talking to one of them okay I'm I'm talking to the guy or the girl it doesn't matter and the other spouse is not there I want to do a lot of pre-f framing so how does your spouse feel about you guys having enough coverage in place to pay off the mortgage and the cars and the credit cards when you pass so she doesn't have to pull the kids out of the school and get a different house somewhere else see I'm pre-framed that oh gosh yeah she she definitely would would I mean yeah she she doesn't want that to happen now they could also say like oh we really haven't talked about it and I'm going to show you what to do if they say that as well okay it's unlikely that the spouse would be like NOP she doesn't she she doesn't want to have any coverage to to pay off all the stuff when I pass away she she just wants to pull the kids out like they're not going to say that you if you frame it the right way if you don't frame it the right way you're going to get in trouble okay if you want help on pre-f framing or framing uh message me directly here on Instagram or the Facebook group and somebody in my team will message you back with different training options if you really want to take this to the next level not just get little bits here and there cuz I hate to tell you that that's not going to quadruple your sales you're going to have to know everything what to do before after everything all right let me give you another example let's say if you sold Home Improvement type in me if you're in Home Improvement or Home Services this is a huge industry for us as well I just had the CEO of A1 garages in here Tommy melow my really good friend on my podcast about three hours ago uh they're about to come a client as well uh but let's say youself cabinates here okay and let's say that uh you're talking to Sheila and the husband's not there or whatever the other spouse okay so how does your spouse feel about you getting in like the kind of the modern looking cabinet so like you said you know you guys feel comfortable inviting your friends over all the parties let's say if they said the cabinets are so old we feel embarrassed to invite friends and family over for parties and events that's an emotional need you're solving you see how that works okay so how did you house feel about you guys getting like a kind of an a modern looking cabinet so like you had said you guys feel comfortable like inviting people over for like business functions and networking meetings if that's what they said okay you see what I'm using I'm just plugging in what they said okay it's hard for them to say no I don't I don't think he would he would want to do that to get to the part they just don't they don't say that okay if you frame it the right way okay once again that's not the first question you ask when you talk to them this is more a little bit into the conversation you know probably close to halfway through or maybe at least a third of the way through when you're asking this type of question if you sell business to Consumer you don't really have the spouse objection if you sell business to business unless it's a tiny business and and maybe the the the two spouses run it together and then that would be relevant okay all right let's say if you sold dental implants okay huge industry one company R TR up in Utah like 700 million in sales last year it's a big indust industry okay so how does your spouse feel about getting implants so you can get rid of all that pain in your mouth when you're chewing and and really get your confidence back to go out in public so let's say their teeth are rotting out they've got yellow teeth just whatever happened I don't know what happened maybe they were on drugs earlier in their life it just things happened right so how did your spouse feel about you you know getting implants so you get rid of all that sharp pain when you're eating more hard Foods now if that was their thing I would put that in there if that's not the thing let's say that they they wanted implants because they wanted to get confidence back to go out in public and they're rotting yellow teeth they don't feel confident when they're out in public okay I'm just plugging that in do you see what I'm doing there if they're like oh no they definitely would want me to do that for sure it's these little pre frames now there's a lot more pre- frames in this I'm just showing you one typically if you're selling business to Consumer there's about five six different seven pre frames you're going to do with the spouse throughout that conversation to really like I'm not kidding you prevent that objection by 70 80% see a lot of you are so focused on overcoming objections I'm focused on preventing them from happening in their mind because the more objections you get is that a good thing or bad thing that's a bad thing that's a myth if you've ever heard of sales trainer says the more objections you get the more likely they're interested how does it make any logical sense what about all the laydowns that didn't have any objections those seem pretty easy they seem pretty interested and they were lay down that makes no sense the more objections you get the less likely they are to buy and objections are triggered by you the salesperson by what you're saying not asking how us your tone that's triggering sales resistance where the guard comes up that triggers uncertain in their brain which leads to objections at the core root of human beings okay this is what I went to school for I'm a behavioral scientist the core root of human beings we all have to some degree a fear of change even though we say we like to change as a human being we are far more comfortable with something that we might not like it that much but we know it better we're more comfortable with staying with what we have even though we don't like that much over something that is new something that is foreign something that is unknown to us okay let me give you an example this it's really basic type in me if you know somebody a family friend relative business associate you work with and when you talk with them all they do is complain about the relationship they're in that's all they do they just complain about the relationship they're in type in me if you know that family member it might even be you I love you but when you when they talk with you all they do is just complain complain about the relationship they're in that's all they do but do you ever wonder and sit back and say why do they stay in that relationship if they don't like it that much well do you know why they stay in that relationship because they're a human and they're afraid of change so that's what you're going up against with pretty much every Prospect you talk to and you have to learn techniques that work with human behavior that get them to overcome the fear of change every objection you get every stall and procrastinated prospect that doesn't buy every prospect that does not buy comes down to a deep-seated fear of change okay Tony I love you yes okay you know me all right now if you want to learn other pre-framed techniques go a and hit the Subscribe button to this channel my only warning is don't share it with your competitors I can assure you you don't want them learning what I'm going to show you in these weekly training videos click the subscribe button does that make sense to everybody every reason why every objection you get at the core root of it is because they fear the change because you they you are giving them a promise of a better future and what they have to do for that promise is they have to pay you first to get the better future they're afraid of that unknown can they really do what they say they can do we have to overcome the fear change okay all right now let's keep going here uh let's see let's just give you a couple more examples here okay now let's say you ask that question so how does your spouse feel about you XYZ and you repeat back a problem or you repeat back in how did your spouse feel about getting you know implants in so you can gain your confidence back when you're out in public what if they said this well I'm not sure I'd have to ask them see every once in a while a prospect can say oh I'm not really sure I'd have to ask them now this is an easy reframe okay because it doesn't matter if they have to ask them I mean know the answer I mean does does she want you to keep having that pain when you're eating I mean does she does she want to be in that situation when you pass and have to sell the house and pull the kids out of the school district if you sold life insurance I mean does she want you to keep getting these lower quality leads and like less listings to grow your real estate business no she wouldn't want that no he wouldn't want that see I'm framing the question where it's hard for them to say yes they would you see what I'm doing there so if they ever come back and say well I'm not sure I haven't talked to them about it because they could say that from that question before that pre-frame question here and there not much if you frame it that right not much okay so all I have to do is go through this so now let me show you example let's just go back to the industry Str I just showed you okay let's say the fitness remember the fitness the 108 lb or 105 lb well I'm not I'm not really sure so does your wife want you to lose the 108 lbs so you're able to walk your your daughter down the aisle when she's when she gets older and get married well I don't know I really have never talked to her about it then I could simply say I mean well I mean does she does she want you to to lose 105 lbs so you don't keep putting all that pressure on your heart and end up having a heart attack well yeah of course she wouldn't want me to have a heart attack see even if they say I'm not sure I'd have to ask them the way you frame it would cause them to be like oh well yeah for sure she would never want that oh for sure he would never want me to have a heart attack see I'm doing that okay I mean would does he want you to lose the 105 lbs you don't keep putting all that pressure on your heart and end up having a heart attack oh no well he wouldn't want me to do that see how I'm pre-framed there see what I'm doing there okay hey Jeremy do you do these lives regularly every Tuesday 6:15 p.m. Eastern and every Thursday morning at 11:00 a.m. eastern we do a Q&A so you got to set your settings so that when I go live on Instagram you get notified same thing with everybody here in the Facebook group there's several of you on here I think we sent on a zoom link to your email uh every Tuesday 6:15 p.m. Eastern okay you'll get an email if you're in that Facebook group or if you're already one of our clients you'd be on the email list if you didn't well I guess you would have got the email always check your spam so if you're on IG and you're already a client or you're even in our Facebook group sales Revolution you're on our email list look in your email because that will get sent out those days as well if you want to get if you want to go live because we go live on like Zoom webinar here on my desktop for people in our Facebook group okay on IG you're on the phone so you can't see as well over here okay say h hi to Andreas for me have a nice day Andre is about three offices down I will tell him that okay now let's go to another industry okay now this is an example of what I call an identity frame this is called an npq identity frame so you want your prospects to identify with like away from the negative and into what they want it's called and write this down anq identity frame okay you're the man JLM thank you very much I really did did somebody pay you to say that Evan it had have been somebody to pay paid you that since joining your program all right good which training program are you in Evan we have like 37 different versions are you in like the npq fundamentals version or beginning level stuff are you in more like n pro versions or sub version that's the midlevel stuff and then Advanced Inner Circle versions that's more the high level stuff that's very very Advanced and uh that's just for individual you know clients uh maybe we train your company and your just in all of our stuff if if we're already training your entire company okay uh all right there you go oh you're an advanced Inner Circle oh good so you're learning a lot what are you learning in there how long have you been in there cuz that's me training you guys we only let 60 people people a month into that program and that's me training it you know what three or four times a week in those smaller Zoom sessions plus the 51h hour portal that you have access to good for you okay now editing frame now let's say if I'm still in that weight loss or Fitness industry I want to show you identity frames how to do this thing okay well I mean good for you well well no for sure she she wouldn't want me to have a heart attack well good for you because you'd be surprised I mean I talk to a lot of people and some of them they just keep pushing it down the road and they never do anything about losing the weight and then you know what ends up happening yeah the prospect yeah they they die of a heart attack yeah I mean if that happened to you like what would be going on in your wife's mind knowing that it could have all been prevented simply by going through training like our training program where you actually lost 105 pounds and it never came back I mean what would be going on in her mind if she knew it' be prevented all by you just changing see how I'm pre-framed again this is so easy Once you learn the skills if you don't learn the skills this is why you lose a lot of deals that our clients who are in your industry they are making all these sales okay all right now take a look at this again what I'm going to show you some of you didn't pick this up you really got to pay attention to my facial expressions your facial expressions are the remote control to your tone try having a confused tone with this straight face you can't really do that right okay pay attention to how I move my hands here you can see me here from my Naval up this is called the trust Zone my good friend Mark Bowden who is a behavioral scientist as well he's a body language expert look up Mark Bowden he's great he calls it the truth plane I call it the trust plane hands up here above the navl this is the trust level he calls it the truth plane same thing look at Mark Bon's a great body language expert okay now look at this had him on the podcast here I don't know probably about 4 months ago you can go to YouTube for the podcast or Apple iTunes we're on all the place you know we're getting 117,000 downloads a day on the podcast now that is crazy that's almost 4 million downloads a month 48 million downloads a year that's insane I just started that like three years ago I thought we were getting like 100,000 downloads a year that's probably where we got the first year crazy all right now look at this I mean does she want you to lose 105 PBS so you don't keep putting all that pressure on your heart and end up having a heart attack oh well no for sure she wouldn't want that well good for you because you'd be surprised I mean I talk to a lot of people and some of them they just you know they just keep pushing it down the road and they never lose the weight and then what ends up happening to them prospect's going to answer that see I'm leading them to the answer oh yeah they they have they die of a heart attack well yeah I mean because if that happened to you what I mean what would be going on in your wife's mind knowing that it it could have all been prevented by simply going through you know training programs that actually taught you how to lose the weight where you never gained it back like what would happen What would be going on in your wife's mind if she knew it could have prevented if you had actually done something about it see what I did there now if I'm talking to a guy see how I planted this see how I did this well good for you now did you see my tone this is really important what I'm showing you on here what's the podcast called closers or losers it's like literally like I think the first or second biggest sales podcast in the world now I think it's like 65th biggest uh podcast on business to but we mainly talk about sales persuasion influence sometimes I'll interview CEOs of large companies are like huge uh business owners and we'll talk about business most time it's sales persuasion influence nine out of 10 times closers are losers okay because they think it's just it's a tagline it's more for marketing but uh yeah it's funny go to closers or losers if you want listen to the podcast we do two episodes a week been doing it for 4 years okay now look at that in frame because you'd be surprised I mean I talked to a lot of people now notice even the Sigh here what if I said it like this okay I am slimming I'm getting into shape I hired a personal trainer it's only been about three weeks uh I'm getting in better shape I've lost about 6 lbs and I'm getting my abs back and my mes back I went through three freaking leg Sur surgeries in 3 months and just couldn't go to the gym so I'm like got to take better care of myself I'm in my 40s now so I'm getting my abs back all that kind of stuff got to look good you know what I mean thank you very much Michael I'm getting slim he but Sim give me about another two months I'm going to get a lot Slimmer a little bit bigger you know that kind of stuff all right so the size really important here CU what if I set it too fast yeah good for you because you'd be surprised I took to a lot of people and some of them just keep pushing down the road and they never lose Lo the weight and then what ends up happening to them oh I I I don't know yeah well they die have a heart attack I mean if that happen see if you say it too fast if you ask questions too fast you give your prospect no time to internalize what you're asking and that's gives you knee-jerk reactions from your prospect if you say it too fast the biggest reason the biggest reason your prospects get you vague generalized surface level answers is because you say things and ask questions so fast that you give them no time to internalize what you just said or asked it just goes in one ear out the other okay does that make sense are you going to do a dedicated session on cold calling at any point we do all that in our training programs for clients ailio uh this is just like a free life maybe I'll do one in a year I don't know uh but we even have a training course that's only cold calling Prospect uh if you're in a virtual training course that's the 51h hour course about 5 or 6 hours of it's dedicated to strictly cold calling and problem statements for all different Industries and we go through that in advance in our sugar program you need to be a client to get all that stuff okay that's why it's hard to master sales by showing up to some lives here and there or even if you showed up to one Live a month you're just you're just never going to master it like our clients are they Master it in months not decades speed to lead right what do I always say the most successful salese do not learn from their mistakes they learn from other people's mistakes they don't make the same mistakes themselves you don't want to keep failing over and over try to figure out on your own I guess you can I'd rather just know how to do it right now so I succeed right now so much of our culture is all about fail fail you got to fail before you see you got fail well the more skills I have the less likely I fail cuz what causes you to fail at sales a lack of skills because you're trying to all figure it all out from free YouTube videos or 60c reels how's that working out for you even if you're doing good well what's going to be what gets you to the next level and the next level there's levels to this ball game we call sales you simply decide which level you want to play the ball game at I always wanted to play at the top level I don't want to wait and keep losing sales that I could be making if I just acquired the right skills you know what I mean all right love that uh ailio just message me directly on IG and either myself or someone my team will message you back because we have like 37 different training programs but it's kind of like we need to know what's going on it'd be like um if you just go to a website and there're just like what do you sell ailio do your prospects just go to a website and there's everything there with the prices and they just choose there but what if they choose the wrong thing that doesn't really solve their problem it's it's almost like driving in your car to a mechanic and saying hey just fix the car how much is it going to cost me hey can you fix a car how much is going to cost me what would the mechanic say well I don't know because I don't know what the problem is I have to diagnose the car I don't I don't know what to tell you because I don't know what the problem is same thing so with any company that's how you should view sales holy I'm so far behind well stop being so far behind oh Cloud software yeah that's a big well you ever heard of a search engine that rhymes with Fugal starts with the G Google yeah we train one of those divisions Cloud software there you go were you on the Bradley podcast yes like three years ago I love Brad uh one of our virtual training programs our 51h hour version is on light speeds platform Brad's a good friend of mine good guy I probably should be on his podcast again he hasn't invited me for three years what the hell is going on okay I know I got 10 more minutes okay now look at this so then I I even side there I mean I talk to a lot of people and you know some of them they just keep pushing down the road they never lose the weight then what ends up happening to them see I'm leading in to get the prospect to tell themselves yeah they die of a heart attack or yeah they get really sick and and then what happens yeah they end up dying I mean if that happened to you look how my tone starts going faster there's more emotion here I mean if that happened to you what would be going on in your wife's mind knowing that it could have all been prevented simply by going through our training program where you lost 105 lb see how I'm eliminating the prospect's objection if that Happ to you what would happen in your wife's mind if she knew it could have been prevented by see see how I'm going there okay now let me give you another example here all right I'm going me give you a couple more examples here let's say if you're a Network marketer or you sold affiliate programs or businesses franchises we train a lot of companies in those space I mean does she and you ask like how does your spouse feel about you starting your own business where you can make more money well not really sure we've never really talked about it I mean does she does he want you to have your own business where you can make more money or just keep having to commute back and forth to work an hour each day oh well no of course he wouldn't want me to do that see what I'm doing there then I go here into the identity frame well good for you because you'd be surprised I mean I talked to a lot of people and some of them you know they just keep pushing it down the road and they're never able to leave their job so they never have the time to be with their family I mean for you and your spouse why is doing this why is doing this so important to you now though I mean for you and your spouse why is doing this so important to you now though see now I'm going to focus on the word now that's a timing thing see this is a different frame here okay teach you all these frames all right frames really prevent objections from happening all right let's go to another one here because I'm going to run out of time actually let me go back to you now what I'm going to do let's say if you keep getting let's say you still get the spouse objection at the end you me to show you what to do okay let's say after everything you've done they still come back and they say I need to talk with my spouse which would be I'm just telling you like you can you can prevent that objection like let's say if you talk to 10 Prospects and you get five out of every 10 that give you that objection once you learn objection prevention and framing like we teach our clients in our courses you quite literally that could go from five down to like one you just you can take 75% of that objection and prevent it from happening you just haven't learned pre-framed how to do it okay do you have a universal first sentence into a cold call there is no Universal sentence because every industry is different now we have Universal formats that you follow for every industry those are our virtual training platforms depends on your industry but our clients have all that so if you want to learn that uh just message me directly and somebody you can message them back okay now let's say they still give you the spouse objection yeah that's not a problem I mean how does your spouse feel about and you repeat back then result yeah that's not a problem how did your spouse feel about you like locking in your rate and lowering your bill let's say if I sold solar okay it's the same thing yeah that's not a problem I mean how does how does he feel about like you know locking in your rate you know protecting yourself from the rate hikes and then lowering the bill it would be hard for her to be like oh I don't think he want the rate locked in I don't think he'd want a lower Bill see that that's hard to do see I'm framing it there that way I don't want to say how does your spouse feel about going solar that that's nothing that that that's not the result of what solar does how does your spouse feel about you getting more coverage how does your spouse feel about you losing some pounds like that none of that is emotional okay none of that does anything for the prospect's brain okay how does your spouse feel about like locking in your rate and lowering your bill okay now let's say they come back like I'm not really sure blah blah blah now let's say in this example you work for a marketing agency and you're talking to a real estate agent about getting better leads so they can get more listings which makes them more sales commissions which makes them more money let's I'm just giving you an example here I mean well oh no I mean she would want me to to get more listings well I'm concerned because what happens if you go to her and she doesn't want you to get the funding to get higher quality Le leads how are you ever going to get to six listings a month without getting a better lead see that's an example of what's called an neq consequence question that's an neq consequence question see what I'm doing there okay all right then right here same thing let's say if you sold solar I could do this for every industry this is all in our I mean this times 10 billion other things that you're going to need if you want to learn how to sell I mean what happens if you go to her and she doesn't want you to get the the the funding like to get the higher leads like how could you ever get to six or seven listings a month without getting a higher quality lead let's say if there are two listings a month but they really wanted to be at six which would triple their commissions see what I'm doing there okay all right now this is an example of looping okay let's say that you still cannot get them to overcome that okay this is another frame that you can use okay this is the heavy as the head that wears the crown uh uh thing we've been teaching this for 5 years I've noticed that there's other people teaching this now I'm like oh you guys stole that from our training program that's okay so then if you ever heard of heavy is the head that wears the crown especially if you're talking to like the main provider let's say that Sheila is the main provider she's a CFO of a company her husband's a teacher because he wants to stay at home in the summer to raise the kids I'm just making something up no I haven't well heavy as the head as Crown is is the one who's responsible for the family like in your mind as a let's say you're still in real estate as a real estate agent whose responsibility is it in your family to generate enough listings to provide them the lifestyle they want well that's mine well can I ask why you're putting that responsibility on your spouse's shoulders when that's your responsibility as the agent now why did I really lower my tone soften it and use a concern tone there why would I ever do that because that's a really sensitive in-your-face question because what if I'm like well then why are you putting that responsibility on his shoulders when it's your responsibility as the agent now they're going to get defensive and now I lost the deal so can I ask why you're as the the the agent you're putting that responsibility on his shoulders when he's a teacher when it's your responsibility as agent to get those listings see how I'm reframing their way of thinking okay then I can then Circle back this is looping I'm going to loop back again and ask the same question I mean does he want you to go from two listings to six listings a month hard for him hard for her to say no he doesn't then well for sure he he wants us to get more listings so what do you feel is going to so what do you feel is is going to put you in the best position to get the six listings the leads you're getting now or a much higher quality lead like what's going to give you the best opportunity to get there okay see how I'm reframing that as well okay now I can also come back well it would yeah because I mean you don't have to get to six or seven you could stay at two I mean it has no impact on me if you only stay at two listings a month I mean who does it impact if you just stay at two listings a month see how I'm detaching myself I'm I'm basically pushing them away to get them to pull me back in see what I'm doing there yeah cuz it I it has no impact on me if you stay at two listings a month I mean who does that impact process says it impacts me so what's going to put you in the best position to get you that six listings a month the higher quality leads like our clients are who are agents in your city or saying with the vendor that you have and I mean reality which put you and get you in the best position to get six leads a month that's a comparative frame that I just did okay anyways hope that helped now type in me if you want to learn
