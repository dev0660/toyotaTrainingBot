all right today I'm going to show you the number one reason why you sound scripted in your prospect's brain come over to the vibe board this is something you don't want to miss because if you're getting a lot of objections especially in the first couple minutes of a conversation it's because you're triggering sales resistance right now here is why I'm going to show you first why do you sound scripted okay why is this happening all right one of the biggest reasons why is you've been taught to ask questions on a script or maybe if you're selling in person you've got your script memorized or or you might be in the office or whatever you're at home so you got the script you know nailed to your computer whatever you taped up there and you're reading it and it's not necessarily because you're reading it it's because you don't sound conversational okay so a lot of you have been trained and look I realize it's not your fault you're trained that way but it is your what it is your problem right and I'm going to help you overcome that so a lot of you ask questions you've been taught to listen and at the end what you do after they after they answer the questions you're like okay cool right right or you say like okay cool awesome or okay gotcha gotcha or oh that's great okay okay let me ask you or you mirror them a lot of you have been taught I got to mirror them so if they say something what I think I heard you say is and then you repeat it back the issue with mirroring I'm going to talk about this for a second is I want you to think about this for a second okay when you're talking with your best friend when you're talking with the relative that you already trust and they trust you do you repeat back what they said to to them do you repeat that back do you mirror them you don't and you don't because that would sound unnatural the problem is you're doing that with prospects and they're human as well and it causes you to sound unnatural because that's not how a natural conversation goes now you don't want it to sound scripted of course you don't want to wing it either it's got to be a skilled conversation but it's got to be a way where the prospect feels like they already know you that you're you're trustworthy all those things so be careful about Mir if you're going to use it use it here and there sparing don't use it that often in a conversation it does not work that well okay and then right here when we putting these filler words after they uh tell us the answer whatever to your question this is because your brain is searching what do I say next you're like okay cool awesome let me ask you and you're searching for the next question the problem is that doesn't sound natural in the prospect's brain because if they're talking to one of their friends their friends don't do this because it doesn't it doesn't they just know what to say next because they already know where to go that's why you sound scripted now I'm going to show you how to overcome that now that's one way I'm going to show you two other reasons why you sound scripted to your prospect so what we're going to do is we're going to use what are called verbal cues I kid you not and verbal cues you're going to bridge from question to question this is called bridging okay so how do I make a conversational conver uh conversation conversational okay you're going to bridge from question of question using verbal cues now what are verbal cues I'm going to have you write these down I'm going to give you a few examples here okay now there's two reasons two ways I use verbal cues the first reason is when they're talking I'm using little words like uhhuh ah really now I'm exaggerating you're not going to do that every two seconds but about every let's say 7 to 10 seconds okay depending on the context when they're talking I'm going to say h right okay I see now like I said you're not going to use them every two seconds I'm exaggerating but every about seven 10 12 seconds you're going to use a verbal cue now I listed eight here in our courses we probably listened 200 all right now here's what I'm doing there's reasons why number one it sounds that you're it sounds like to the prospect you're actually listening to them so you're present in the convers ation you ever been on a phone call with somebody and you sit and talk for like two minutes straight and they don't make a sound what do you do hey are you still there is because you can't tell if they were present because you didn't hear anything out of their mouth okay now the second reason is like I said you use them to bridge from question to question I'm going to show you some examples right after this pay attention to what I'm about to show you this could literally make or break deals you're losing like you should be making these deals right now that you're losing a big reason is because you don't know how to bridge from question to question yet yet as I said yet that sounds that makes it sound and feel like the prospect that it's a real conversation not a sales conversation right now verbal cues once again shows them present your in conversation causes you to sound natural not scripted okay now what does that do why is that important for you to sound natural because it causes the prospect to let their guard down okay now one thing you want to understand this is just Behavioral Science 101 your prospect so every human being on this planet has built up what are called Defensive mechanisms in their survival part of their brain a lot of scientists would call that The Reptilian part of the brain or survival part of the brain okay so anytime you feel or Prospect feels like they're being sold to that comes from like the tone the body language the words if your words sound like most salesp people selling them anything that's triggering their brain to go into what's called fight okay so fight or flight mode okay you ever had a telemarket or salesperson call you hey is John there hey John it's James Miller with XYZ company hey the reason why I'm calling you was now instantly where does your brain go either fight you're like not interested and you get defensive or flight mode hey I'm really busy can you call me back later that's what is triggering your brain based off the tonality of that salesperson or the words or both if you sound like every salesperson's ever tried to sell them you're using the same words verbage and your tone sounds monotone like a telemarketer or sense way high pitched like a really excited salesperson or even worse timid like a really salesperson that doesn't sell that much they're automatically going to trigger this and they're going to try to get rid of you okay so I want to use verbal cues in that conversation to get the prospect to let their guard down rather than the guard up and that helps them open up emotionally in that conversation because how many of your prospects open up emotionally to you and tell you everything if they're guards up none of them do and it's hard to make a see if they're guards up okay now let me show you a few examples of verbal cues I'm going to remember I'm going to show you how to bridge from question to question now in this example let's say you sell for a marketing agency you're a salesperson and let's say this company is maybe they're not getting enough leads through their own efforts maybe the leads they get are not very good okay I'm just taking whatever they say ah and and now you're going to ask questions before this these would be these would be what we call situation questions okay I'm helping them find out what their real situation is so I've already asked what we call connection questions okay they're guards down so they've already told me some things then I'm oh okay what what are you doing now to to generate new leads and clients ah and what are see Ah that's a verbal CU see how I'm bridging so if the last question I asked him so let's say it was a book called they show up on zoom and what were you hoping Could Happen by possibly working with this well I'm hoping that we can get better leads and blah blah blah ah okay and what are you doing now to generate new leads and clients though see how I Bridge ah and okay ah okay what are you doing now that's a verbal CU now most salese after that first question and answer would say okay cool yeah it sounds like you need good qualified leads in right right uh let me ask you what are you doing now see it sounds scripted sounds like a salesperson but if they're like ah we want qualifi leads ah okay and what are you doing now to generate new leads and clients though see I'm bridging quick ah okay what are you doing boom right into the question keeps the prospects guard down okay oh we do this we do that H okay and how long have you been running ads on Facebook oh we've been running okay we do ads on Facebook YouTube ah okay and how long have you been running ads on Facebook and YouTube though Ah that's a verbal Cube see how I'm bridging into the next question guard stays down because it sounds conversational see what we're doing here oh we've been running ads on Facebook for the past five years okay what what cause you to go that route rather than all the other options out there though oh okay what cause you to go that route rather than all the other options out there see oh okay and what see that's a verbal CU see I'm bridging from question to question if I could show you a roleplay if had some of the office I'd show you this how this works okay now one thing you can do is I think I have some videos on here where actually role play so after this uh search for those maybe I'll get I'll find those for you okay now verbal pausing this is just as important as bridging from question to question using verbal cues okay when I verbal pause what that means is it causes the prospect to pay attention to what I'm about to say causes their brain to hone into the next words I'm about to say okay that triggers what curiosity okay it also causes them to think deeper about what you're asking or what you're saying think about some of the most famous speeches you've ever heard in your life uh maybe Martin Luther King that I Have a Dream speech okay I don't have it word for word but think about all the verbal pauses he did in that speech what if he said that really fast what if actually I'm going to show you so he said something like this I might be off on a few words I have a dream that one day all men and women will be created equal not based on their skin color but by the XYZ now that was for verbal POS I have a dream pause that one day pause see now those verbal pauses right there trigger you to pay attention it triggers your emotions now what if you would have said it like this I have a dream that one day all men and women will be credit equal not based on their skin but by the Deeds they do and he just talked Straight Like That fast you wouldn't even remember that speech because no one emotionally would have been impacted by it because there was no verbal pauses I kid you not there was no verbal pacing of what he said so you wouldn't the people listening to it then wouldn't have internalized that and really connected with that emotionally the verbal pausing and the pacing of the question triggered everybody listening and still to this day to emotionally connect with that speech brilliant speech okay all right now I'm going to show you some examples this pay attention this is really important okay so let's say in this example let's say you sold cyber security okay and you know maybe they're talking to you because something is wrong with the way they got something set up maybe their fraud stack is set up wrong and so here's what I'm going this is what's called an npq problem awareness question now if you're not one of our clients neq stands for neuro emotional persuasion questioning this is a methodology I invented from my Behavioral Science Background in University and my 18 years uh in four different Industries 2 B Toc 2 B Toc during my career before I retired and started seventh level sales training company okay so I'm going to lean in this is after I've already you know connected with them disarmed them with connection questions I've already found out what the real situation was with situation questions now I'm going to build a gap and help them find problems okay so I'm going to lean and say so are you 100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack is set up so is your management team 100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack is set up see how I did that now where did I verbal pause right here before 100% And then I verbal pause right after that before satisfied with the way you're fraud stack verbal pause is set up now what does that do because imagine if I did it this way so are you 100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack set up yeah it's pretty good see said the question too fast I asked it too fast so I give the prospect no time to internalize what I just asked but when I slow down and I verbal Pace it out this is called verbal pacing okay write this down unless you're driving in a car don't drive this don't try to write it down if you're driving I'm pacing in the question so I mean you you guys have had this set up with XYZ vendor the last five years are you a 100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack is set up see the skepticism there I'm concerned I've got a concerned tone a little bit of skeptical tone now why would I say 100% why not say are you satisfied because no human being is what 100% satisfied or happy with anything they have right let's say the person you're with now your partner first couple months you were happy they could do no wrong they were an angel that had wings right six months into the relationship you find something you might not like yeah right nobody just the human nature nobody's 100% happy with what they have there's always things they want better okay that's why I'm using 100% right there see what I'm doing there now a lot of you guys have questions in the comments section about how do I apply to my industry jemy or what do I do if the prospect says this or says that I don't respond to a lot of comments in the comment section although I do want you to comment about what you've learned from this or what you want me to do in the next training video so the easiest way to get a hold of me is simply to text me all right so I'm going to give you the number I put it on here on the board it's 48637 2944 so 48637 2944 just text me on that and I will get back to you and answer your questions okay let's move on to the training hope you wrote that down quick for those of you didn't nothing I could do all right npq probing question here now let me show you how to verbal pause so let's say that the prospect says something's really important these are just generic okay not industry specific I'm going to show you this so why is this so important to you now though can can I ask why this is so important to you now though now why would I verbal pause right before I say the word now because now where did I cause your brain to go why this whatever this is fixing whatever let's say getting a life insurance policy while this life insurance policy whatever going solar whatever is so important to them now that's a timing issues notice how I verbal pause right before the word I want their brain to think about okay now this question is the exact same question word for word but notice where verbal pause here which is now going to get their brain to focus on what why this thing they want or this problem they want to solve why that is so important now okay right here I'm focused on the word now so it's like a timing like why do it now I'm building urgency subconsciously in the brain can I ask why that's so important to you now though well the reason why it's important now see I got their brain to go there because I have verbal PA what if I said it this way why is it so important you now though if they're an easy sale like a lay down they'll open up to that if they're not I don't cause their brain to think about that okay it's too fast they'll give me a knee-jerk rection well just I'm still looking yeah it's just important now because we've been talking about they're going to give you vague answers now here can I ask why this is so important to you now though this is whatever the thing is so let's say if it's back to the marketing SE qualified leads why so why is qualified leads so important to you now though or I say so why is this so important to you now though okay now I've got their brain to focus on this simply because I verbal paused right before the word I want their brain to think about and a verbal paused right after it forces the brain to think about that try that next time it works wonders now that's called like I said verbal pausing okay let's keep going on because I don't want you to sound scripted now let me give you a few more examples here this is an example of what's called an inq problem awareness question let's say that I have some type of SAS product and it weeds out flaky truck drivers because truck trucking companies if they hire flaky truck drivers and they get out on the road two weeks later they don't like it where does that all that cargo set in the parking lot collecting dust and they lose thousand tens of thousands of dollars a day by not being delivered so it's very important they find the right drivers so let's say that you're on a conversation your SDR has already cold called them now you've got a booked appointment on Zoom okay so you've been advertising oned the last 12 months I mean do you 100% like the results you've been getting see I could ask it that way okay so let's say they said they've been on indeed trying to find good truck drivers for the last 12 months I repeat that back and then I'm say do you 100% like the results you've been getting now what did our brain what I caus the brain to force to focus on the word 100% And like the results this is where they're do you verbal pause so the brains here do you 100% like the results you've been getting now what if I said it this way do you 100% like the results you're getting yeah they're not bad so do you 100% like the results you've been getting notice that's that concerned tone tone that's concerned for them it's a little bit skeptical as well okay now let's say that you're in the recuiting Staffing industry I can show you this for every single industry watching me here I can show up for your industry watching me okay so you've been using indeed the last three years I mean what's caused you to feel like that's not getting you the best people okay now I couldn't use that on a cold call I'd have to restructure it that different so you been I mean you guys have been using indeed so now am I going to ask this question the first question no wouldn't make any sense okay this is in the conversation I've already opened them up I've disarmed them with my connection questions I've helped them understand what their real situation is when I ask situation questions now I'm building a gap from where they are to where they want to be I'm helping them find problems so rather than saying can you tell me two or three things you don't like about indeed well most prospects aren't going to open up to that because they know where that question leads so right here I'm teaching you how to reformat the question with verbal pauses here that's going to cause them to defend themselves on why what they have is not going to get them where they want to be so I'm not understand you've been indeed with indeed the last three years I mean they're fairly decent I mean what's caused you to feel like that's not getting you the best people though okay well don't get us wrong jery it's done a good job for us but for us to get to the level we feel like and now they defend themselves on why they feel like that thing whatever they have is not going to get them where they want to go is that a good thing for you yes it is okay now let's keep going here I've got a few more examples to show you let's say that I sold life and same thing and let's say this lead I find out in situation questions that they've already got an 80 or 100K work policy now I want to get rid of that as an objection because what if they come back and say well we're good we already got the 100K work policy like you know if I pass away you know I'm going to be good my family's going to be taken care of so I'm going to say so I'm not understanding you've got this 100K word policy I mean what's caused you to feel like that's not going to be enough for Cindy and the kids to live off the rest of their lives see what I just did there now I get him to him or her to internalize why the word policy caus you to feel like that's not going to be enough for Cindy and the kids to be able to live off their entire life okay now I get him to visualize that to think through that him or her and now that emotionally causes him or her to feel pain and have a fear of future pain when they're not there so you've already got the policy with State Farm I mean what's caused you to feel like that might not be enough for sending their crits to be able for sending to be able retire on time now he's forced here or she's forced to Think Through why that policy is not going to be enough they already have okay now there's more to that that's a verbal pause right there okay let's go through another one let's say if you sold Financial Services all huge Industries for us so I mean you've been with AER prize the last 10 years I mean what's caused you to feel like that plan might not be able to retire you by the time you turn 61 now notice all the verbal pauses right here right here right here and right here okay now Mar prise I love you I'm actually one of your clients I invest a lot of money with you but because you've never reached out to us for us to train all your salespeople I have to put you in these YouTube videos there you go you should reach out to us a a prize I love you I love the returns we just could help you sell a lot more to those people I love you all right so you've been with AER priz the last 10 years I mean what's caused you to feel like that plan might not be able enough to retire by the time you turn 61 say even ver pause right here okay now cause you to feel not think why would I say feel instead of think because do human beings make decisions logically or emotionally emotionally 100% of the time brain studies prove that there's no there's no debate among behavioral signs on that okay I feel like a drink of water because I'm thirsty I feel like notice every decision you make starts with your emotional side of the brain so you want to keep them on their emotional side of the brain when you start saying what do you think you're taking their brain back to the logical side don't do that unless you want to lose sales okay cause you to feel like that plan might not be enough to retire you by the time you turn 61 second pause differently let's say and I'm just repeating back let's say they said they want to retire by 61 instead of 67 I'm causing them to defend themselves on why the plan they have they feel is not going to be enough now like I said a lot of you guys have questions so if you have questions how do I do this for my industry or you got any type of sales questions best way to reach me
