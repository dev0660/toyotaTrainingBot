do you know that feeling of being inside of a car dealership and being pressured into something that you don't want well in this video i'm gonna teach you exactly how to outsmart someone like me i've been in the car business since 2000 and i've seen a lot of techniques of people trying to get the best deal some of them are good some of them are bad so these are going to be my five favorite things to teach you to walk in with confidence into any car dealership and walk out with a great deal number one you want to start on your own turf we all hear home field advantage right when you walk here you are the visitor you are the one who is in the the deficit of trying to get a good deal always start with emails phone calls and of course in this year in age text messages by doing all this on your home turf it gives you the upper hand because they have not gotten you in the door yet and their number one goal to get you to buy a car is to get you in the door because if you're not here you can't buy a car number two keep your trade-in to yourself you do not want to tell them you have a trade-in until it's the appropriate time you need to be at home and know exactly what your car's worth based off of multiple third-party reviews kelly blue book truecar my website chevydude.com you can also use carvana and carmax but carmax is more realistic carvana is going to give you way more money than you ever thought your car was worth but using those three to five to six sources to figure out what your car's worth is gonna pretty much give you an idea of exactly what your car is going to be so there's no reason for a dealership to appraise it until you're ready to do a deal so the best time to bring up your trade-in is when you have decided that you're going to buy the car the dealership is offering you and if you truly want to save thousands of dollars on your next car purchase join me on my next private live stream over at autocarbine101.com i'm going to share with you three secrets that i've never shared publicly that literally will save you thousands of dollars at the end of this video check out autocarbine101.com and i'll send you the link number three this one is a big one and i've talked about it in the past before but you gotta be wary of any type of fun advertisements i'm talking about hey we're gonna give you five thousand dollars more than your trades worth we're going to give you more than what kelly blue book says uh the big one is is if you get a flyer in the mail and it's got a key attached to it saying you could win a car or come in and win a trance for a vacation or anything like that especially here in 2021 and 2022 dealerships don't need to do anything to earn your business profitability is high inventory is low the demand is extremely high it's like shooting fish in a barrel right now when it comes to selling a car so dealerships who are doing that are only doing it for one reason and that's to take advantage of you another big one that i hate is tent sales off-site sales or maybe that they are doing a big sale that they bring in people from outside of the dealership that's the ones you need to run from immediately absolutely never work with a car salesman at a dealership unless they're actually employed by the dealership and how would you know if they actually work for the dealership autocarbine101.com number four this is where you lose as a consumer and the car salesman wins you've got to know the difference between price and payment car salesmen will get you to fixate on the payment because they know that's when they can take the most and biggest advantage of you and put the money that they want right in their pocket i have the best worksheets on chevy dudestore.com so that way when you are talking to the car salesman that you can take notes and write down everything you need to make sure that you have factual information you need to make sure that you understand the price of the car the original msrp on a new car the market price on a used car taxes that you're obligated to pay all the associated fees the dealer doc fee and if you're to the point of talking trade-in you know what your trading is worth based off of what your payoff is if there is one as soon as the car salesman can get you off of the real numbers over to the payment you can be easily manipulated at that time and that's when the most profit happens and if you are a payment shopper you've got to know exactly where to go to get your own payments and figure your own interest rate dealerships will set there and manipulate the interest rate on the worksheet so that way you just don't know what it is but if you go with the good rule of 20 for every thousand that you finance so a one thousand dollar car is gonna be twenty dollars per month a twenty thousand dollar car four hundred dollars per month thirty thousand dollar car six hundred dollars per month you see my math but you can go on to one bigger step if you go to google and type in car payment calculator a nice car payment calculator will come up you can put exactly what you want in there as far as how much you're going to finance your own interest rate your own term it is going to give you the payment dead on and number five this one is so crazy important and this is one way that you're going to beat that car salesman and most importantly beat his manager as well and that's don't shop at one place in 2021 and 2022 the biggest thing with all the inventory shortage crisis that we're having is you think that you only can shop at one place and then you've got to make a quick decision where that is primarily true you still have the upper hand if you have some time willing to spend when we're talking about new cars the definitely the biggest thing is is contact multiple dealerships so you can find out what they have inbound and also what maybe is waiting for a microchip processor to put into it i myself bought a truck that had to have a microchip processor put in after it was built it's not a big deal it's very simple so use that to your advantage when it comes to used cars dealers take in trades every day and most importantly some dealerships will have a service that they can find something for you at auction that's something that i do here at the dealership i find cars all the time for people and how do you shop at multiple dealers at once go back to number one text email call on the phone work the dealers and let them know that you're shopping around and that you were looking for this this this or this or if it's based on price or where the case may be now you guys know i always under promise and over deliver so yes there is a sixth thing in the five things of how to outsmart a car salesman but this one just came up in a real life scenario i have a facebook group and a discord server where we talk about car buying tips all the time if you're not part of that there's a link in the description but this one is so important and people do it so wrong know exactly what you can afford before you contact or walk into a dealership the easiest way for you to be outsmarted by a car salesman is them convincing that you deserve it you've done so much work you can afford this just do it that is horrible horrible advice trust me i've seen it over the years before walking into the dealership you need to know exactly what you can afford monthly payment you need to contact your insurance agent and give them a vin of a similar car that you're looking at so that way you know what insurance is and look up on the internet of what you think projected maintenance and cost will be obviously if you're buying a new car you've got some lead time of having very limited costs if you're buying a used car you may have bigger exposure at buying a car with more costs associated with after buying it so you need to understand exactly what a payment is going to be we talked about it already in this video you need to know exactly what the price is going to be we talked about it in this video and most importantly you need to know that generally speaking that you don't want to payment over 15 of your pre-tax income if you've got a great carbine tip that's worked for you let me know in the comments section because i've got over five pages of notes here for this one video and there's no possible way that i could share all of these notes in this video so that's why i created the auto carbine system that's gonna save you thousands on your next and future car purchases make sure you check it out at autocarbine101.com
