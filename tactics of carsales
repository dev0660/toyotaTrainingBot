that you know Perhaps Perhaps uh I could end up buying that truck uh okay thank you sir appreciate you calling in um if you don't mind may I get your name really quick yeah my my name's uh Ray Ray Allen A l an is my last name all right Mr Allan appreciate you calling in so you mentioned you're interested in one of our pickup trucks can you give me the I don't know do you have a stock number do you have a vehicle information again that you could share with me I'll look it up in our system I do the stock number is 0 FD 5819 okay give me a second here let me look it up I'm just going in our computer system really quickly here he said 0fd 58019 and and Mr Al if we happen to get you know uh our connection Disconnected by any chance would you be able to share your contact information with me I just want to input that in my system as well oh absolutely I'll be more than happy to give you my uh my cell phone number which is uh 555 823 7489 don't ask me to repeat that cuz I'll probably never remember it all right Mr I've pulled up the vehicle right here yes this is a beautiful brand new 2024 Ford F-150 XLT 4wheel Drive uh are you ready to come into the dealership and take it for a test drive and and uh you know take it home is is that something you're looking to do well here's the thing I am looking at this pickup truck and uh well I hate to say this but your competitor has an identical truck I know it's not identical identical but it's the same MSRP I am I am anticip ating purchasing this truck or a similar truck by the end of the month so today's what the the 22nd 23rd if if you can get me a competitive out the door number I very well could be taking delivery of this truck within the next few days well Mr Allen I appreciate that so it sounds like you're talking to another one of our dealer dealership competitors that's a okay we totally understand but if I could get you here to the dealership to actually test drive the vehicle I think that'd be really important so that you can understand kind of the feel of that wheel that'll maybe help seal the deal I I would love to get you down here and uh and get you in the truck how's that sound when are you available you know that that sounds great except um I promised my wife we're not going car shopping until we have numbers at hand so I need to get your best out the door number um and and quite honestly I'll be uh as honest as I can and transparent with you Zach I'm going to share that number with your competitor so please make sure it's a competitive number number so that uh you know if you have the best number that's where I'm buying the truck now Mr alen we know a lot of Shoppers are very price sensitive they're really trying to make a smart financial decision I will share with you here we are a no BS transparent dealership here at gcha Ford you don't get the name gotcha without getting them a great deal so Mr Allen would love to help you out here just talk to me a little bit about your monthly budget like do you have an idea of what you want to be spending per month on this vehicle um actually monthly budget doesn't matter the only thing I'm interested so that I can compare apples to apples is what the out the- door price of the truck is going to be after the after the deal or discount after any Factory incentives um so that selling price plus State fees and any dock fee that you might have I need that bottom line number because that's what I need to compare with the other dealership so can you help me with that I I hear you loud and clear okay you've been very very very communicative that you want this out the door number the one thing I'll need from you Mr Allen is your ZIP code that way I can look up what the estimated taxes will be if you were to purchase this vehicle but before you give me your ZIP code do you mind sharing with me is this something you plan to purchase with cash Finance would you lease the truck how do you think about that um well I I could do any of those three um so it could just be a straight up cash purchase um if it makes sense for me to finance um and and there's some good financing available I might take advantage of that I'm probably out on leasing but those items are things that we can take care of once we've established that out the door price oh and by the way my ZIP code I just live a few miles from your dealership so it's your ZIP code okay perfect Mr Allan I hear you all options on the table probably not at least which kind of makes sense that F150s don't lease particularly well so that I got it down pat before I get the out the door number one thing that can influence an out the door number is if you have a trade in do you happen to have a vehicle you'd be looking to sell Mr Allan um don't worry about that I uh at this point in time that's irrelevant what's important I'll say it just one more time for you what's important is I need to get that bottom line out the door number um so that when I call your competitor down the street I can I can compare apples to apples uh the only fair way to do it is to compare apples to apples and I know that's what you'd want me to do I am a huge Apple fan uh I mean the fruit and I would love to be able to help you compare apples to apples and again I'll just let you know at gotta Motors we have the gotcha guarantee so I know our competitors don't have that as well I'm excited to share more with you on that all right I'm not authorized to share pricing over the phone Mr Allen that being said let me go talk to my manager Mr gotcha himself and I will give you a call back at the number you gave me earlier can I call you back back in about 10 minutes five would be better but sure within 10 minutes would be [Music] [Applause] [Music] great yeah hello hello hey uh Mr Allen this is Zach chefa here from gotcha Ford do you have a moment I do and thank you for getting back to me as quickly as you have yeah absolutely like I said about 10 minutes I tried to do it under that as you requested I have that out the door price from you and my manager said this is as low as we can go he'd love to get you in here at the dealership today so you can put your hands on that car and take it home you got a pencil and paper I can read it out to you I do I do what is that number all right so we've got an out Theo price of $ 62,3 71 now let me walk you through how we got to that number we're giving you a tremendous discount off of MSRP over $5,000 off a selling price of $ 56,3 153 now here at gotcha Ford we have a $799 documentation fee processing fee every single customer is charged that unfortunately we're not able to do anything about that we've got an estimated tax for you of about $2,168 and then some government fees that add up to about 60 bucks 50 bucks excuse me now we also put on all of our vehic Les a Ford protection plan this is going to be about $3,000 and that's how we end up at $ 62,3 71 there you go Mr alen that's our best lowest number like I said transparent up front here at gotcha Ford we'd love to get you in here today so you can take this thing home uh what's what's the what's the $33,000 protection gotcha sounds like you're getting me that actually is the the uh the I I know I said Ford protect it's the gotcha protection plan uh we just put that on all of our vehicles and make sure that if you have any type of issues in the next 5 years your truck is completely taken care of at any gotcha Motors dealership uh what if I don't want that well you know that's a that's an option but I I think that's something that we would have to discuss when you come into the dealership to make sure we could accommodate um if you if if you'd like me to come into the dealership that's probably something we'd have to discuss before I get there well I uh I I hear you Mr Allen um I know you're shopping us around as well and talking to other dealerships like I said every vehicle gets the gotcha protection plan so that we can always get you back in here to take care of that truck so we'd love to make sure that that's on this vehicle it's really for you not for us so you know it's something that we can uh and we can bundle it into the financing so I know you are open to financing so you don't even really have to think about it it only comes out to about $20 a month if in the financing as well so that's something to to consider here certainly something to consider and certainly something I'll discuss with your competitor when I give them a call um so if it's okay with you Zach um I've got your number at gotcha Ford and I'll get back to you would that be all right sounds great Mr Allan thanks so much for your time thank you hello uh Leonard here with simple Ford how can I help you uh hi my

a dock fee ours is $799 taxes I need to know your ZIP code to get your taxes can you give me a sense of where you're located I can run that real quick um I I only live uh 10 miles from your dealership

the folks over at gotcha where they I did and and you're exactly $3,000 less than them I do have a question I know you have a a recent college graduate discount do they have anything for an old College Dropout discount I I can check in our in our Vincent system is what they call call it here at Ford I'll double check in Vincent and see if uh see if we've got that I don't think that program

aggressively they want to get it off the lot um well I I must say and and and and I don't necessarily want you to take this as a compliment but you can take it as a compliment simple Ford has made this simple for me I I love the fact that you were willing to just share the information with me UPF front and and you know I got to say because of that I think I need to do business with you folks hey well why don't you make your way in or if you'd prefer I I can take down your contact information here and we could start everything online beforehand just let me know Mr Allen like I said thrilled to be able to help you I really appreciate it I one last question for you Zach uh assuming that we do a lot of this uh uh via the Internet how much time am I looking at spending at the dealership once I get there uh I would say in and out and under an hour we've got a few things that we'll want to show you with one of our representatives to help make sure that you understand everything in these new F-150 there's a lot of F-150s excuse me there's a lot of technology in them so under an hour if you wanted to make it even half an hour we could do that but we'd want to spend
