do you know why so many salespeople suck at cold calling and say it's dead because they're using what we call the numbers game strategy come over here I'm going to show you exactly why and exactly how to get much better at cold calling than you are right now here's the numbers game strategy right you always hear that in cold call just got to call the numbers just get more Nos and you'll eventually get a yes imagine Steph Curry in the NBA saying basketball is just a numbers game shoot as many threes as you can eventually you're going to hit one out of 30 well Steph had that mindset he would have never made it on his varsity basketball team let alone be an NBA Hall of Famer Steph knows it's a Skills game so I'm going to show you skills but I'm going to first show you why you're having problems all right now most salese use some type of cold calling approach that sounds like this or some type of offshoot of this it's one or two things hi is this John hey John it's Jeremy Miller with XYZ company listen the reason why I'm calling you is and then you go over why you're calling now what do n 99% of prospects do at that point oh uh yeah I really appreciate it but we're not interested uh we already have somebody for that oh oh now we're good I I appreciate it click okay you're triggering fighter flat mode and I'm going to show you why that happens now the second way some people have been told how to cold call something like this some form like this this works a little bit better than this old school approach it's been around since like the 1950s okay but this works a little bit better but still didn't play the number game hi is John there John hey it's James Miller now hey full disclosure this is a sales call it's a cold call uh if I could just go over a few things that we're doing you know within one or two minutes and then you can tell me if you're interested if you're not I'll just hang up fair enough now that works a little bit better but a lot of prospects most of them will still say hey not interested we already have somebody for that right after you get to that next point or they might say yeah fair enough and then after about 30 more seconds like oh not interested we're already good we already have somebody for that so this doesn't work that well either okay now why do those two techniques not work because you are triggering especially with your tonality look I know it's it's not your fault okay you you were trained how to cold call that way not your fault but it is your what it is your problem okay and that's what I'm going to help you fix here so what you're triggering is called Fireflight mode so anytime the prospect says quickly not interested we're good we already have somebody for that that is a knee-jerk reaction based on defensive mechanisms in the brain so as a society because we're already always marketed to and sold to all the time we have built up defensive mechanisms in our survival part of the brain most people call that your reptilian part of your brain or other other names out there okay so anytime you sound like a salesperson so if your tone is monotone like a telemarketer reading from a script or you're way too excited I don't mean be boring there's a middle ground like an expert you're right in the middle you're triggering those defensive mechanisms where you literally sound like every salesperson that's ever cold called them ever ever knocked on their door ever called them on the phone ever tried to sell them anything you sound like them so they instantly try to get rid of you okay that's because like I said your tone makes you sound like everybody else and then they throw out objections okay now there's a lot more I could go into there but I'm going to save that for another training all right now here's the skills game approach I want to trigger curiosity in the prospect's mind which causes them to want engage I wanted to use what we call a pattern interrupt now for every industry we train this we train 161 different Industries and all the subcategories of all those Industries which would include your industry watching me here according to Forbes Magazine there's quite literally only 163 Industries on the planet and there's subcategories of each one we are in all of this we only two industries we don't like salt Mining and something else that nobody even knows what is okay so I want to have a pattern interrupt I want to interrupt their patterns because if I'm like hi my name is I'm with XYZ company the reason why I called is that's the pattern they're already used to they're already used to that script they know what that is instantly they're triggered when I pen interrupt I'm going to show you three or four different industry specific examples in the formula to do it for your industry I throw them off they don't their brain doesn't know what's going on so it automat aut atically causes them to be curious it causes curiosity it triggers curiosity in their mind that's what you probably want and I also want to use right when I co- call what we call a familiar tone where they feel like they already know you okay you ever get a call from somebody like hey John it's it's Amy Amy Smith how are you doing and you're like I'm I'm doing good how are you and you just go with it for the first 30 45 seconds trying to figure out like who's Amy Smith who's Amy Smith I did did I go on a date with her did I go to networking event with her maybe she's at my church like you don't know but they sound so familiar because their tone that you sound it be it would be too rude for you to say who is this you just wouldn't do it because your tone is a familiar tone so I'm going to show you some examples on how to use a familiar tone with what you sell and then I'm also going to show you how to use what we call a confused tone now let me specify I don't mean confused tone like you're 96 years old and you have dementia and you're confused like you don't know what's going on or like you're in your presentation like oh I don't know how it works that's not what I mean a confused tone is like when you walk into some like I I'm not sure I understand like where should I actually be going over here and people come to your rescue because you sound confused like you need a little bit of help so I'm going to show you in certain context at the beginning really only the beginning of a coold call how to use a confused tone to trigger more curiosity I bet you're curious about what the h dou l i mean by this right now if you are now what I want you to do is comment in the comment section right now your biggest struggles with C call and so while you're watching this video go down to the comments and make a comment about your biggest struggles right now when you C call because I'm going to read those after to make some more training content around that to help you okay now this is a generic example of we what we call an any PQ problem statement instead of focusing on the reason why I'm calling you is and going into your solution ution and all the benefits and features which goes in one year out the other prospects I want to focus on one or two problems that I know anybody that answers that phone depending on the industry I'm calling or the company would know about because it triggers curiosity okay now what I'm also going to do is in every industry and like I said we train out of the 163 Industries on the planet in subcategories we're in 161 of those I'm going to go out and Limb and say that we already train your industry and in every industry that Cole calls we have developed what we call pattern erupts by having them say they're holding a copy of something that that Prospect or that company would know about okay let's say if I'm a real estate agent and I'm calling expired listings yeah I'm holding a copy of your of the expired listings it looks like you had your home up for sale about 6 months ago the 55 Willow Lane home so I'm holding something uh let's say if I'm a uh you know a recruiting agency yeah I'm looking holding a copy of the the ad you have about looking at like six new truck drivers for the job next month see whatever it is I'm holding a copy of something it's an example of a pattern erupt where it's hard for them to say not interested I want them to say oh who is this again or or what do you guys do or or who are you with I'm triggering curiosity all right now I also want to use a familiar tone so when the prospect answers I'm immediately doing this yeah is John there yeah John hey it's it's it's Jeremy uh Jeremy Jeremy Miller I'm holding a copy of your blank and I was wondering if you could possibly um help me out for a moment yeah it's it's Jeremy Jeremy Miller notice that little verbal pause I'm going to say the first name here first little verbal pause and then you're going to say your entire name now depending on your industry I'd be careful right here at this part of telling them uh what company you're with so let's say if you I don't know if you sold real estate for example I'm with XYZ real your a automatically giving away what you're doing so it depends on like I'm with XYZ Solar Company you know you don't want to do that because like oh solar not interested so you don't want to trigger that so it depends on your industry will depend on if you're going to say your company's name here or if you're going to say it later down in here okay I just want to specify that now let's see what I just did this is all generic right here I'm going to show you three or four different industry specific examples to help you structure your problem statement right after this okay so I'm holding a copy of your blank and I was wondering if you could could possibly help me out for a moment now notice this goes into more of a right here and here this goes into a confused tone now this right here is a familiar tone remember I said hey it's it's it's Amy Amy Smith how you doing see that's a familiar tone when I say yeah it's Jeremy Jeremy Miller uh see that sounds like I already know them like they already know me if you use that familiar tone you really got to practice this verbal Pace at there yeah it's Jeremy Jeremy Miller with XYZ company I'm holding a copy of your uh blank and I was wondering if you could um possibly help me out for a moment then I go into that confused tone okay notice I'm Shuffling the papers why am I doing that because they can hear that and it triggers in their brain what are they shuffling especially when I say I'm holding a copy of your blank I'm Shuffling the copy of whatever that is you see what I'm doing there okay uh let's say if I'm a CPA firm calling wealthy business owners maybe I print off their revenue report from the year before okay it just it just depends on who you're calling right now here at this point I then have to disarm them okay I got to make them feel like I'm not sure I can help you yet does that make sense okay like if you're if you get too assumptive too quick in that conversation especially if you're calling a type c-level Executives on a cold call you were going to trigger Massive Resistance very quickly because they don't know who you're like a complete stranger now that doesn't mean you don't get assumptive further on in the sale when You' built more trust and you built a bigger Gap but here 10 seconds in how much trust or credibility do you have like zero cuz you're like a stranger cold calling them okay now right here at this point I've got to get them to let their guard down so I've kind of got to say I'm not quite sure we should even be talking about I'm not quite sure if I can even help you yet I've got to get them to let their guard out I can't be assumptive 10 seconds into a coold call because how much trust and credibility you have with a complete stranger zero at this point so if you get too assumptive too early before you built any trust or credibility especially with a type C- level Executives you are going to get crushed on coold calls because they don't know who you who you are from Adam or Eve okay so immediately say I wonder if you could possibly uh help me out for a moment uh sure how can I help you or what's this all about well and I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk yet see how I'm downplay I'm downplaying it but I'm also like acting like I'm not quite sure I can even do anything yet that's a disarming technique now do we know we can help them yes does a prospect know we can help them in 10 seconds no because you have zero trust and credibility so I have to get them to let their guard down it's a disarming technique that's it okay as I build more of a gap build more Trust of course I'm going to get them by the end of that conversation if my uh agenda is to get them to book an appointment for a sales call or whatever let's say about SDR or something then I'm going to build that Gap but here at the beginning they don't know much about it well and I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk okay or I can say this well and I'm not even sure if if you're the right person I should be talking to I called to see who would be responsible in your department for looking at like any possible hidden gaps in your blank that could be causing the firm to blank who should I be talking to about that okay now there's two different ways I could do this depending on the industry I might start off here well I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk yet now I'll show you different examples as I show you or I would say this well I'm not even sure if you're the right person I should be talking to I called to see who would be responsible in your company for looking at any like possible hidden gaps in your blank that could be causing the firm to blank like who who should I be talking to about that now notice I did a few things here on this form here I'm I'm not even sure this is a disarming technique right here I'm not sure if you're the right person I should be talking to and then I said I'm called to see who would be responsible it's hard for the person who is responsible to say no I'm not responsible okay I call to see who would be responsible in your company now if it's a big company I might say Department depends on if I'm selling at the Enterprise level or more SMB if it's Enterprise I'm going to say Department if it's the company I'm going to say the company if I know that the right company person's answering the right Department person's answering if I don't I'm going to say company and look at any like possible no notice I'm still neutral here I'm using the word possible I'm not too asstive yet I don't have much credibility 20 seconds in possible like hidden gaps in your blank that could be causing you guys to blank that's the consequence and then immediately you lean and said who should I be talking to about that like it's a serious thing okay now that is the generic version I'm going to show you some industry specific versions so you understand how this works okay okay let's say that you sell healthc care SAS all right in AI now as well if you want to get more industry specific spefic training for your industry go ah and hit the Subscribe button because a lot of times I will come in here and do a couple different training videos a week where I get more industry sub spe can't talk industry specific throw some water in my face so if you want more of that hit the Subscribe button and maybe one of the other training videos If you comment below what industry you're in in the in the comments tell me what industry you're in and what you actually sell maybe I'll make some YouTube videos around your industry to make it industry specific so hit the Subscribe button and then comment below if you want that now let's say if I sell healthc care SAS okay it's a big industry R training as well and I have some type of SAS product let's say it has to do with AI and let's say I'm selling to hospitals or doctors and on average the average doctor has to dictate their notes manually about 90 minutes to 2 hours a day so if they're doing that during work hours that means they can't see patients during that two hours a day that means the hospital lose two they lose two billable hours a day per doctor that's a lot of money that I could solve if my AI uh if my AI stuff did that automatically now why do they have to dictate notes and make sure they're accurate because if they don't that means they could prescribe something that is not good for the patient the wrong medication it could kill the patient then they get sued it also could mean that they don't dictate the notes the right way and the insurance companies don't reimburse the hospital so they don't get paid okay it's a big important thing here or maybe they're dictating their notes at the end of the day and they miss their little Johnny soccer games or Linda's you know ballet classes or piano classes and they want to spend more time with their family okay so you're solving that emotional need so right when they answer I'm going to take a drink of water here you get that throat going always affects your tone so right when they answer yeah is is is this Linda yeah Linda hey it's it's Jeremy uh Jeremy Miller I'm holding a copy of your online uh patient reviews I was wondering if you could uh possibly help me out for a moment uh sure how can help you what's this all about well and I'm not even sure who I should be talking to I I called to see um who would be the person like responsible for helping like your doctors you know reduce the time they're having to you know being forced to dictate their notes that might be preventing them from seeing more patients and causing the hospital to lose like more billable hours like who who um who should I be talking to about that okay now let me do this over again with you I want to use a little bit better tone there and I want to go through the whole thing and I'm going to shuffle the papers like I'm doing it like live in person all right okay now here we go yeah is this Linda yeah Linda it's it's it's Jeremy uh Jer Jeremy Miller with with ABC company I'm holding a copy of your um online uh patient reviews I wonder if you could possibly um help me out for a moment these are for like 2023 uh sure online patent reviews yeah and I'm not even sure if if if you're the right person I should be talking to I I call to see like who would be the person in your hospital that would be responsible for like overseeing how the doctors like kind of reduce their time that maybe they're being forced to dictate their notes manually that might be maybe preventing them from seeing more patience each day in the hospital losing out on like billable hours like who um who who should I be talking to about that see now I'm going into that confused tone like I don't know who I should be talking to or who the right person is same thing I call to see who would be responsible it's hard if they're the responsible person it's hard for them to say I'm not responsible responsible for helping the doctors now notice what I did I focused on the problem reduce the time they're being forced to dictate their notes what's the problem preventing them from seeing more Patients Hospital to help the hospital get more more billable hours see I'm focused on that now most people you're calling if you're calling a hospital or some type of doctor or something they would know about this stuff so it resonates like oh most of the time I will tell you 87% of the time from our clients in from this industry they're like yeah 80 85% of the time they're like oh that would be Bob over at and then they tell you okay and then instead of saying oh can I talk to Bob or is he available you're going to do it a little bit differently like well should I should I have you transfer me over to Bob and leave a voice message so they can call me back if they'd like later to see if I'd be available it's easier for them to transfer you over to leave a message now the thing is that Bob's there he's going to pick up the phone anyways okay so you see how I'm I'm I'm kind of giving them the milk a little bit before the meet I'm not saying oh can I talk to Bob now is he there or does he know you're calling uh should I have you transfer me over to Bob's phone and leave a voice message so they can call me back later to see if I'll be available for them sure okay see the difference in that all right now sometimes they respond we don't have time to go through that just kind of showing you the basics here now let me show you a few other examples maybe we'll get that into another training video okay now let's go here all right let's say let me show you a different example here okay show you one more here maybe I'll show you two here's a Pann up now let's say that you cold call okay and let's say that you're a real estate investor and you're cold calling distressed properties okay to go in and buy those homes for maybe 30 or 40% less than what they're worth fix them all up then resell them for a huge profit that's a huge industry we train as well as real estate you can also use this a similar version of this if you're a real estate agent calling expired listings you would just say you're holding a copy of uh older listings in your hand about their home at 55 Willow Lane and I'll show you what to do there so let's say that you're distressed you're calling distress propertys yes is Sally there yeah hey Sally it's it's Jeremy uh Jeremy Jeremy minor I'm holding a copy of your uh property taxes on your 55 uh Willow Lane home there in Savannah I was wondering if you could um possibly help me out for a moment now at this point they don't know if you're the IRS they don't know if you're a county clerk they don't know who the heck you are in pretty much every County in America you can go actually out and print off the property tax records for any home that you're calling just so you know so you're going to hold those in your hand yeah it's Jeremy uh Jeremy Miner I'm holding a copy of your uh property tax records on your 55 Willow Lane home there in Savannah and I was wondering if you could um possibly help me out for a moment see now I'm confused possibly help me out for uh sure what's going they're always say uh sure or oh you have my property tax records like who who you're from and then immediately I got to disarm them oh yeah s and I'm not just you know I'm not quite sure if it even makes sense for us to talk yet see I've got to disarm them I got to get them to let their guard at oh well and I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk I represent a group of buyers who are purchasing I want to say it's like six or maybe I seven different properties in that five block area where your Willow Lane home is at and after they had me look at your property tax records They had me reach out to see if you'd be I don't know maybe opposed to having a brief conversation on the property would you would you be against talking about that or would you be opposed about having a conversation around that or I could say let me call you to see if you would be opposed to maybe even getting an offer on that property would you would you be against talking about that now what did I do here this is a disarming technique well I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk see I got to get them to let their guard down then notice how I'm looking through the papers yeah I represent a group of uh buyers I'm looking to buy I'm going to say it's five or six different properties there in that five block are will Lane home is and after they had me look at your uh property tax records They had me reach out to see if you be maybe even opposed to getting an offer on that property would you be against talking about something like that now why would I say the word opposed or against rather than saying are you open here's the here's this here's the kind of the scientif the science behind it what is the what is the word that the prospect on a cold call feels the safe is saying to you the word no not yes but see if I say would you be opposed to having a brief conversation on that no I'm I'm not necessarily opposed like what do you have in mind it's hard for them to say yes I'm opposed they want to say no it's a safer word for them to say or are you opposed or are you against or would it be a crazy idea to talk around or would it be completely unrealistic to have a conversation about an offer okay those are just words where them getting I'm getting them to say no which leads them to eventually say the yes okay I've been using that since I sold door to door in the ear early 2000s no getting them to say no eventually to say I did that in alarms too I'd be like are you I mean are you i' get to that like what happens if you don't do anything about this and like an intruder breaks in like when your family's here are you going to let that are you going to let them are you going to let them do that now this is after I've obviously built a gap I wouldn't say that in the first two minutes they'd slap me in the face but after I built a big trust and big gap I can challenge them more are you are you going to let them keep do like are you going to are you going to let that happen to the house I did to the Jones family okay you're not going to say that in the beginning because they'll slap you around but gim said no I'm not going to let that happen okay or if I'm like trying to raise funds for like a political candidate I could do the same thing are you going to let that person take over the White House this year and force us to do blah no I'm not going to let that happen which leads to a yes I'm going to give you money for a fundraiser okay it's the same type of concept okay now let me show you one more example I think you're going to like this let's say that you sold a recruiting software to recruit top truck drivers for truck companies because a lot of times those companies will get in like flaky uh drivers okay from like indeed or some type of like little ad and a lot of times they might you know get their license start working for 2 3 4 weeks then they don't like being out on the road they're flaky they jump from job to job and then that cargo sits in the parking lot and that company lose tens of thousands of dollars a day because it's not being delivered on time so let's say that you have some type of software that reads out bad candidates only gives you the good candidates so you have solid people to drive your trucks it's the same type of thing here okay let's see here I'm going to show you what to do yada yada yada okay perfect this is like this okay now notice the pattern rup I'm holding a copy of one of your recent ads see what I'm doing here yeah is this Wanda yeah Wanda hat it's it's James uh James Miller I'm holding a copy of one of your uh recent ads you guys have on indeed about looking for like reliable drivers I was wonder if you could uh possibly help me out for a moment now right now Wanda doesn't know if you're applying for the job she doesn't know what's going on because I interrupted her pattern I use the familiar yeah it's James James Miller and then I'm pattern up I'm holding a copy of one of your recent ads on indeed now she knows about the recent ad right so that makes sense I'm holding a copy but looking for Reliable drivers I was wondering if you could possibly help me out for a moment so I could do this if I was a recruiting agency too recruiting or staffing agency same type of pupt okay then I've got to disarm them well and I'm not even sure who I should be talking to I'm trying to reach the person who's responsible for like overseeing any possible like hidden gaps in like your systems to recruit like really solid top drivers that might be caus you to hire several that maybe end up quitting sometimes who who should I be talking to about that see what I did disarming right here not even quite sure if you're the right person I should be talking to trying to read the person who's responsible and then possible hidden gaps I'm still neutral here in your systems recruit top drivers that might be notice I'm still neutral might be causing you to hire several that kind of end up quitting sometimes who should I be talking to about that like I'm confused uh that would be George over in Human Resources should I have you transfer their voicemail to leave a message so they can call me back later to see if I'd be available okay or I can say like this okay here's another one here let's say if I know them okay I already know the person answer is the right person okay or let's say that I already know who I'm looking for I'm calling a bigger compan I'm looking for Todd Benson let's just say okay yeah it's it's it's James J James Miller I'm holding a copy of one of your recent ads on indeed about you guys looking for like more reliable drivers and I was wondering if you could um possibly help me out for a moment sure how can help you well I mean as Todd Benson in as I understand he's the person responsible for maybe looking at any hidden issues around your recruiting process about hiring top drivers that might be causing a few hires to kind of be flaky and quit should I who should I is Todd bin around where I can talk to him about that just a different angle okay now let me give you one more example because let's say you get transfer to Todd Benson okay ah here it is right here I missed it you guys use for new drivers that might be causing you to lose more like solid drivers that he could be hiring is he available okay confused to now let's say the gatekeeper transfers you over you're calling a big big company here and they transfer you over to Todd Benson okay here's how that conversation would look once the person that you're trying to reach actually answers their line okay let me see if I can enlarge this for you guys real quick good Lord no maybe not let's see what I can do ah here we are okay yeah this is Todd yeah Todd it's it's uh James uh James smer with ABC company I'm holding a C of one of your uh recent addon ads on indeed about you guys looking for like more reliable drivers and Debbie over in dispatch she I just talked with her and she mentioned to me you might be the person responsible in your department for looking at maybe any I don't know possible gaps in your recruiting process it could be forcing you guys to keep several trucks vacant each month because some drivers end up quitting and then you might be the person to talk to about that possible issue should I be talking to about that okay see how I'm doing that all right all right hope that helps you today that is the biggest reason why so many salespeople suck at cold calling and then I showed you kind of a generic format of what's called an NQ problem statement and I gave you about three or four different industry specific examples now if you want to learn more industry specific examples for industry in the comments go down right now hit the Subscribe button first because I'm going to go through more training on this in the next couple weeks and then comment what your industry is and maybe I will help you with some problem statements for your industry so comment the biggest thing you need help in and maybe on the next training video I'll actually because I read your comments I will shoot some training content around that to help you close more deals hit the Subscribe button I'll see you on the next training video
