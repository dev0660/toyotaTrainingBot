Car Sales Objection Handling Strategies 

Common Sales Objections and Responses 

1) Price is Too High 

Objection: 'The price is too high' or 'I found a cheaper option elsewhere.' 
Response: 'I completely understand where you're coming from. Let’s break down what you’re getting for that price. This vehicle includes [highlight features, warranty, etc.]. With these additional benefits, it’s a great deal in the long run. What do you think?' 

2) I Need to Think About It 

Objection: 'I need to think about it' or 'Let me get back to you.' 
Response: 'Of course, it’s important to make the right decision. Would it help if I provided you with all the numbers and facts today, so when you think about it tonight, you’ll have everything you need to decide?' 

3) I’m Just Looking / Not Buying Today 

Objection: 'We’re not buying today; just looking.' 
Response: 'That’s great! It’s smart to take your time. Let me help you find the perfect vehicle, so when you're ready to make a decision, you’ll know exactly what you want.' 

4) I Want to Shop Around 

Objection: 'I want to check out other dealerships before deciding.' 
Response: 'I completely understand. Let me ask, if this were your last stop and you liked both the car and the deal, would you feel comfortable moving forward today?' 

5) I Need to Talk to My [Spouse/Partner/Parent] 

Objection: 'I need to run this by my [spouse/partner/parent] first.' 
Response: 'I understand you want their input. What do you think they would want to know? Maybe I can help answer any questions so you can both feel confident.' 

6) The Monthly Payment is Too High 

Objection: 'I can’t afford that monthly payment.' 
Response: 'I hear you. What monthly payment would work better for your budget? Let me see if I can adjust the terms or offer other options to make this work.' 

7) I Don’t Want to Pay That Interest Rate 

Objection: 'That interest rate is too high.' 
Response: 'I understand. Your rate depends on several factors, like credit and loan terms. Let’s work together to find the best rate we can offer for your situation.' 

8) I Need to Know What You’ll Give Me for My Trade-In 

Objection: 'Before I do anything, I want to know what I’ll get for my trade.' 
Response: 'Absolutely. Let me show you how we calculate top value for your trade-in while also ensuring we’re getting you the best overall deal.' 

9) I’m Waiting for [Tax Refund/Bonus] 

Objection: 'I’m waiting for my tax refund/bonus to buy.' 
Response: 'That makes sense. What if we structure the deal so your first payment isn’t due for a few months, giving you time to get everything in order?' 

10) I Want to See What Other Dealers Offer 

Objection: 'I want to see what other dealerships are offering.' 
Response: 'I completely understand wanting to compare. Let me make sure you have all the details here, so you can see the value we’re offering, and if you’d like, we can revisit any concerns after you’ve had a look around.' 

Advanced Objection Handling - Andy Elliott’s Pocketbook 

1) I Have A Few More Cars I Want To Look At Before I Purchase 

I understand. Let’s say you already checked out the other vehicles, and mine is the last one on your list. What would be the deciding factor for you? Would it be purely about the vehicle itself, or about getting the best deal? Exactly! So it’s not a matter of **if** you’re going to buy, but **when**. 

2) I Like The Car But The Miles Are Too High 

I understand how it may seem that way. However, if you were to purchase a vehicle with fewer miles, you’d have to spend more money. If you drove both vehicles for a 3-year period, which one would you end up owing more money on? The one with fewer miles! Because with this vehicle, the biggest part of the depreciation cycle has already been absorbed.
