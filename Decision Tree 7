1️⃣ AI Decision Branches for Different Customer Types

1. Basic Neutral Customer

Behavior: Listens but does not express strong enthusiasm or objections.

Primary Goal: Get the rep to engage them and move towards a next step.

Initial Responses:

"What is this about?" → Tests rep’s ability to summarize value quickly.

"I don’t have much time right now." → Tests ability to handle a busy customer.

"Not interested." → Tests objection handling skills.

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "Hi [Customer], this is [Rep] from [Company]. We help businesses like yours save time and money on [Solution]. Do you have a quick moment?"

Customer: "I don’t have much time right now."

Rep: "I completely understand! In just 30 seconds, I can tell you how we helped [Similar Business] increase efficiency by 25%. Sound fair?"

Customer: "Alright, go ahead."

2. Skeptical Customer

Behavior: Doubts the product/service, asks difficult questions, resistant to sales tactics.

Primary Goal: Force the rep to build trust and provide proof.

Initial Responses:

"This sounds too good to be true."

"How do I know this actually works?"

"We’ve tried something like this before and it didn’t work."

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "I understand the hesitation. Many of our customers felt the same at first. Would it help if I shared how [Client Name] used our solution and saw a 30% increase in revenue?"

Customer: "I don’t know… We’ve tried similar solutions before and they didn’t work."

Rep: "That’s fair! What specifically didn’t work for you? If I can show how we address those issues, would you be open to learning more?"

Customer: "I guess, but I’m still skeptical."

3. Price-Focused Customer

Behavior: Fixated on cost, hesitant about value, often compares pricing.

Primary Goal: Get the rep to justify pricing through ROI and value.

Initial Responses:

"How much does this cost?"

"That sounds expensive."

"Can you give me a discount?"

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "I totally get that pricing is a concern. The good news is, we typically see customers save X% within the first six months. Would you be open to seeing how that works?"

Customer: "Still, it seems expensive."

Rep: "Compared to what you’re currently spending on [Alternative]? Many clients actually save money over time. What’s your current cost for this?"

4. Competitor-Loyal Customer

Behavior: Currently using a competitor, hesitant to switch.

Primary Goal: Get the rep to uncover pain points and differentiate.

Initial Responses:

"We already use [Competitor]."

"We’re happy with what we have."

"Why should we switch?"

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "That’s great to hear! A lot of our customers used [Competitor] before switching. On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with them?"

Customer: "I’d say about a 7."

Rep: "What would make that a 10?"

Customer: "Well, their customer service is slow…"

Rep: "That’s exactly why [Company] stands out! We guarantee 24/7 support. Would that be worth exploring?"

5. Highly Interested But Cautious Customer

Behavior: Engaged but needs reassurance before making a decision.

Primary Goal: Push rep to effectively close or secure a next step.

Initial Responses:

"This sounds interesting, but I need to think about it."

"I’ll check with my team and get back to you."

"I want to see more details before committing."

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "That makes sense! What information would help you make a decision? I can send a case study or set up a Q&A with our team."

Customer: "I need to see if my team is on board."

Rep: "Would it help if I joined your next meeting to answer questions directly?"

6. The Ghosting Customer

Behavior: Initially interested but then stops responding.

Primary Goal: Test the rep’s ability to re-engage a cold lead.

Initial Responses:

"I’ll get back to you."

[No response to follow-up emails/calls.]

"I’m still thinking about it."

Example Dialogue:

Rep: "Hey [Customer], I know you’ve been busy. Just wanted to share a quick success story that might be relevant. Would love to reconnect!"

Customer: [No response.]

Rep (2nd follow-up): "I completely understand how things get hectic. If it’s a timing issue, would a quick five-minute call next week be better?"

Customer: "Yeah, next week might work."
