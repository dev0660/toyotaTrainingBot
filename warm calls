Ultimate Guide to Warm Calling for Auto Advisors
Since every customer in your system represents a “warm” call—even if they haven’t reached out to buy a vehicle—each interaction should build on any prior connection they may have with your dealership. Treating these calls as warm conversations allows you to introduce value, nurture leads, build rapport, and increase the likelihood of future engagement. Here’s a comprehensive guide to make the most of these calls:

Understanding the Difference Between Cold Calling and Warm Calling
Cold calling and warm calling are two distinct approaches in sales, each with its own purpose and strategy.
Cold Calling: Cold calling involves reaching out to individuals who have no prior interaction or established relationship with your dealership. In these calls, the customer is typically unfamiliar with who you are and may not have shown any interest in your offerings. This approach can feel more transactional and requires more effort to build initial rapport and establish credibility.
Warm Calling: Warm calling, on the other hand, focuses on connecting with customers who already have some familiarity with your dealership. These may be past customers, people who have inquired online, or individuals who have visited your service department. Since there is an existing connection, warm calling conversations can be more natural and less formal. This approach allows you to personalize the conversation based on their previous experiences, fostering trust and making it easier to engage.
By leveraging familiarity and past interactions, warm calling enables you to move quickly into value-building discussions, making it a more effective and comfortable experience for both you and the customer.


Why Warm Calling Works
Warm calling helps you connect with potential customers who may have had a previous interaction with the dealership, even if they haven’t shown explicit interest in buying right now. Here’s why it’s effective:
Reinforce Familiarity: Even if they haven’t reached out to buy, contacting them as a known entity makes the conversation feel friendlier and less like a cold sales pitch.
Build Trust-Based Connections: Warm calling allows you to reinforce an existing relationship, making future conversations and visits more natural.
Create Long-Term Interest: By showcasing valuable options or inviting them to visit, you’re planting seeds that could turn into future sales opportunities.





Key Elements of a Warm Call
A successful warm call focuses on introducing value, building rapport, and understanding the customer’s needs:
Personalized Approach: Use the customer’s name and reference any past interactions, such as service visits or previous vehicle interests.
Introduce Value: Mention updates or offers relevant to them, like new models, special financing, or service promotions.
Build Rapport and Listen: Engage with open-ended questions to understand their current situation and preferences.
Set the Foundation for a Future Visit: Invite them in for a casual visit, offering specific times to make scheduling easy.



Warm Calling Approach
Step 1: Do Your Prep Work
Before calling, spend time reviewing the customer’s profile in the CRM to approach the conversation with confidence and context.
Check Past Interactions: Note previous conversations, service history, or inquiries.
Gather Relevant Info: Identify potential needs, like upcoming service milestones or interest in certain vehicle features.
Example CRM Prep Note: “Customer serviced their 2018 Toyota Highlander in July; showed interest in hybrid models.”
Step 2: Start with a Warm, Friendly Opener
Begin the call by acknowledging your existing relationship and showing respect for their time.
Example Opener: “Hi [Customer’s Name], this is [Your Name] from [Dealership]. I was thinking about you today because we have some updates that might interest you. Do you have a moment to chat?”
Step 3: Introduce Value with No Pressure
Share information that could be beneficial to them, emphasizing that there’s no obligation.
Example: “We just received the new hybrid models that offer great fuel efficiency—since you mentioned interest in hybrids before, I thought you might like to know.”



Step 4: Highlight a Friendly Reason to Visit
Offer an inviting reason to stop by, such as a no-commitment test drive or a promotional event.
Example: “We’re hosting a special preview event this weekend. It could be a great opportunity to check out the latest features. Would you like to join us?”
Step 5: Offer Specific Appointment Times
Provide two specific time options to simplify scheduling.
Example: “Would 10:15 AM or 3:45 PM on Saturday work better for you?”
Step 6: Confirm the Appointment
Follow up with a confirmation message including all necessary details.
Confirmation Message: “Looking forward to seeing you at [time] on [day], [Customer’s Name]! Our address is [dealership address]. Feel free to call if you have any questions.”


Handling Common Objections on Warm Calls
“Not Interested” or “No Need Right Now”
Response: “I understand completely! I just wanted to keep you informed. If anything changes, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re always here to help.”
Timing Objection / Not the Right Time
Response: “No worries at all. When the timing is better, we’d be happy to assist you. Is it okay if I check back in a few months?”
Price / Cost Concerns
Response: “I get that budget is important. We have a range of options that might fit different budgets. If you’re interested, we can explore these together at your convenience.”
Trade-In Value Concerns
Response: “That makes sense. An in-person appraisal can give you an accurate idea of your vehicle’s value whenever you're ready.”

Best Practices for Warm Calls
Use a Friendly, Confident Tone
Positive and Professional: Speak warmly and sincerely.
Smile as You Talk: It enhances your tone and makes the conversation more engaging.
Be Ready to Pivot
Ask open-ended questions to uncover how you might assist them better.
Keep It Short and Focused
Aim for a 2-4 minute call, concentrating on providing value and setting up a future interaction.
Choose Specific Appointment Times
Offering precise times on the :15 or :45 makes scheduling straightforward and memorable.



Additional Tips for Salespeople
Practice Role-Playing Scenarios
Work with peers or supervisors to role-play different call scenarios. Practicing responses to common objections will help build confidence and smooth out your delivery.
Respect Customer Preferences and Compliance
Always check if the customer is on a Do Not Call list and be mindful of any preferences they’ve expressed about how they’d like to be contacted. This shows respect and builds trust.
Use Personalization Techniques
Go beyond just using their name—mention any specific details you know, like their preferred vehicle type or last service visit, to make the conversation more relevant.
Follow Up with a Text or Email
If the customer agrees to a visit, follow up with a quick text or email confirmation. This reinforces the appointment and makes it more likely they’ll show up.
Track Your Call Outcomes
After each call, jot down notes in the CRM on how the conversation went and set reminders for follow-ups. Tracking outcomes helps you learn and improves future calls.
Listen to Your Peers’ Success Stories
Pay attention to success stories from fellow advisors who’ve made effective warm calls. Ask them what worked and try those techniques on your next call.
Build Customer-Centric Language
Focus on customer benefits in your language. Instead of saying, “We have new models in,” try “We have some models that might be a perfect fit for you based on what you liked about your current vehicle.”
Use the CRM as a Tool for Personalization
Add notes about each customer’s preferences and past interactions in the CRM. This helps make your follow-ups feel natural and shows customers that you remember details that matter to them.
