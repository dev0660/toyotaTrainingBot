guys they do it it's Andy Elliot I'm here today with my man Levi come on you guys have probably seen Levi in other videos Levi's 19 just crushed it out last month and anyway saga of a conference room here in Norman Oklahoma Levi swings by talking a little crap instead hey you know what I said they live with me let me run ten injections on you real fast so we're gonna drop them on the board I got it right here I've got me a nice little tin that I picked nothing too crazy nothing too crazy got these chin right here I'm gonna run him by Levi I got a little pencil right here I'll put 89,000 down 399 a month I'm not gonna be too hard on him but look roleplay is how people get better okay so Levi be a 19 whether he was 59 1930 it doesn't matter every single day I role play here in my conference room me and Tony grind it out for about 30 to 45 minutes and get sharp I believe it's important for every salesperson in the country if they want to go to the next level to do this so Levi comes by says hey man bust me up for a minute and even though I do in-store training with them there's always keeping that that that sword sharp from both ends yeah so we're gonna roll through it we're gonna see how he does and at the end hey give us a thumbs up on the video Yeah right this is one of the new studs coming up but guess what more importantly I want us to keep training together but I want you to find somebody in your store that you can go through these ten objections with and see how you handle it and I'm not gonna really critique him I'm just gonna give them the objection I'm gonna let him hammer in it and leave us some comments below and let us know how he does okay let's rock out so here's the pencil $89,000 390 I'm good and we'll start out with objection number one Jackson number one is going to be I don't have any cash down hope I make it a simple so that's completely fine um so let me ask you this what are you currently pay on your vehicle right now I pay about five hundred a month 500 dollars a month okay that's fine so you're currently paying five hundred we don't even cash down right now so what I'm gonna do is when we go to extend your payment out to six and a half weeks until your first payments that's gonna take care of my first $500 that I need for your down thing so looking across town that leaves with $500 remaining right well you know 99% of my customers typically like to put their you know half of their cash down I'm on a credit card because you pay that out throughout the year right you know ten fifteen dollar minimum right so which you know which which credit card you didn't want to put the downpayment on perfect what we might have basically said is this like your next car payments gonna be do how much is it I said five hundred bucks you said awesome you're gonna have to make that anyways so we'll take that for five hundred down because that was gonna have to be paid anyways whether you bought a car today or you didn't is that that was an X payment he took that and he said now at the other 500 guess what most of my customers like to put it on a credit card which Craig forgot to put it on you can pay it off through the year ten fifteen dollar minimums good news you don't have to put it down today you just swipe the card there you go makes sense there you go it's a good one all right I don't want to finance 84 months hold on I forgot to put this up here let's just what in the world right down 84 easy sir okay let's act like this has 84 months on it listen I'm gonna explain this to you a lot of the times your management will push your customer out what term yeah that's how we make money that's how we get to the payment to make the deal but a lot of the times we'll get fight back with the customer saying I don't want to finance that long okay so that's what this objection is it's I'm tellin Levi I see your proposal I see it says 84 months I don't want to finance 84 months Levi I wanted at 60 months okay sleep I can't understand that but for right now you're good with the payment right yes the payments fine okay cool so realistically in order for me to you know decrease to increase your payment but that's not a problem at all so between eighty four months and sixty months are gonna have the same term and you like back in the 90s that would probably change you know your overall APR but for right now it's gonna be the same so why go up to 60 months what do you keep the same payment right now and you know be able to make that payment throughout the entire year because you have months you know you have seasons like Christmas Easter vacation and stuff like that where you know making a bigger monthly payments gonna be a little big you know harder on it so I know what you can do is you can do 309 a month and make an extra payment autumn of the year and you know that'll decrease your overall payments five probably about a year by the time you and your turn and you'll pay it off in sixty months you decide to make it much much pay as much for it as you possibly could I love it what do you basically said is look why not leverage the bank's money if the same rates are roughly gonna be the same on sixty seventy to eighty four why not take the longer term keep the lower payment and then have you have the power to pay off more as you go when you want to pay more instead of forcing yourself on a 60 month term with the higher payment yeah so since I was okay with that payment obviously it makes sense for me to stay on the 84 and understand that there's no benefit at going 60 it doesn't help you that was that was even though centuries ago that doesn't happen anymore right okay so I'm just going to sell this is me this is on the trade-in right dannion I didn't put the trading up there let's just say it's the 7000 for the trade okay I'm gonna tell we buy I'm gonna sell my car outright so I can get more money for it okay I understand that so you could hear right now you probably could sit on this car and you know wait to sell for a long time you shouldn't be making payments on the car right now and you said your paints out our doors a month right well you know I've coordinates time I walked for two three months at a time so I could be anywhere from you know a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars and you're gonna pay waiting to sell this car right now to give you $7,000 for it you know as it is only I've ever heard the Craigslist killer the Craigslist killer oh no it's a real thing look another promise and I used to meet people I guess Asia need kill him you know when there sell their cars so yeah it's a great way to do it so what I can do is I can go do that $7,000 right now and make sure that you know give you for market value for your trade well let me ask you this so if you came here because you like the price of my vehicle right yeah okay the reason being is because I was able to give it give them a good number for their trade and be able to resell it for a very fair price so same thing I'm gonna do with your vehicle you can you know maybe even look at as maybe painting for just a little bit okay fair you gave a great answer and I think that that's a great way to go all right we're going to number for Levi I need to get back with you tomorrow I'm gonna go home and sleep on it okay well first of all it's the car deal we can't sleep on it just easy um no realistically you know you know you woke up this morning you know you need a little car alright okay and you came here you found my car obviously you like the car could start a working number right right okay um so typically like 99 percent of my customers and they say they you know they need to go home and sleep on it because somewhere in the deal I'm missing you so we're we're on this piece of paper on missing you that you know I could help you I'm gonna run your business today great job listen I need to sleep on it is a smokescreen yeah it's a stall it's not a real objection people don't need to go home and sleep on it what they want to do is go home and text you what can my best still look like so you're trapped he says it's not falling for it listen I never send my customers right when they say they need to go home and sleep on it it's probably cuz something's wrong with the deal so let's go back to the deal right that's exactly what you need to do great job man all right so it was a stall yeah I always remember that that's not a real objection it doesn't mean anything nobody can overcome that we got to get back to the deal all right let me do a little more shopping around okay and I'll get back with you so you I understand that realistically you know you woke up this morning you're in come look at cars so before you like my car most of the terms have been agreeable and ninety percent of my customers when they say that you know they want to go shop around a little bit more because there's something on this piece of paper that I'm not gonna learn your business on today so where where do I need to help you in order to get you in this vehicle get back on the finance office okay that was good what he did again is realized I need to go shop around a look at a few more cars listen I wouldn't be this far and beat a number if I wasn't serious about buying it so the neat deal about it is and say obviously you woke up this morning you thought you were going to go looking for looking for cars you didn't look for one you found one you loved now we're working numbers on it now you need to shop for more ninety-nine percent of my customers when they say they need to shop for more what they mean is that something is wrong with the deal saying that what part about the deal are you not okay with yeah right yeah that's that's exactly what he was saying he was really close on that one but that right there that's perfect bottom line is take it back to the deal yeah it's not about shop than other cars it don't ask the dumb question well what other cars you're gonna go look at you cannot people mess up and say that you know the sudden here's the funnel you're out here stay in here yeah right okay good job all right so what's this we got five more okay this is a good one I want you to watch Levi space Levi look at the camera when you answer this one okay is this your best deal absolutely but there was another do you know if there's a better deal to be brought out I would have already brought out to you the reason being is because I don't just want to sell you this car I want to sell you every car that you buy at the rest your life as well as your family and friends so I want to earn your business on this one make it you know as agreeable as possible so you know you remember me next time you want to go buy your next car good he gave me an answer that's all it's about and guess what you did a good job a lot of guys yes what'd they say little here a little there guess what you showed that slight budge boom they're gonna pop you for it okay exactly absolutely that's my best deal yeah absolutely that right there needs to be said all right good job dude that was simple but I wanted to see you safe yeah yeah sorry to make it alright alright this is a good one does anybody see an interest rate on this piece of paper no Levi what's my best interest rate or I'm sorry Levi what is my entry strumming okay um so actually I'm I'm not licensed go right my customers favor what I can tell you his interest is relatively easy um so with good credit you know you can have a good interest rate with less than perfect credit you're gonna have was the perfect interest rate let me ask you this how's your credit I think it's pretty good okay perfect you're any other great rate and Finance we go over all that with you in them you know the finance office so okay that's it it's an answer did he say let me go ask my manager and I'll get back with you no did he say give me just a second and let me go figure it out no he says I'm not licensed to talk about it yeah but guess what however your credit is you already know what kind of rate you're gonna get that's the beautiful thing about it guess what they'll go over with you in finance that's awesome these are simple questions that allow a salesmen to do his job and it allows an F and I guy to do his job yeah as much as you may ever know never play the guy that knows it all did a good job all right all right we got three more okay so I decided I'm gonna wait a few months to purchase so I can save up some more money to put down okay okay so obviously I understand that roughly how much money were you plan on stayin out to put down mmm probably five thousand five thousand dollars okay Helen II was gonna take you roughly to save that $5,000 probably three months three months okay that's fine so what that being said obviously the first thing to do for you is I can go in extend your first payment out to six and a half weeks so after you know after I do that you'll make you know your first payment and then by then you know that's roughly about half that time so we're gonna use you and walk in your local bank you have a down payment ready for them cuz you're only gonna make one payment and you're gonna refinance with them at that point you could take your car that you want home today because there's no guarantee that's this car still going to be here and I get these terms for you whenever you want to come back and refinance so you're walking out a local bank put that $5,000 down three financed with them and you're good to go can I get a lower back yes sir hey how hard was that good job man pretty simple none of these are difficult but it's so funny how we can make these difficult good job man I love it all right we got two more let's see how Oh Levi does he'd be your crack from these last two son okay this man these are easy okay Levi I won't pay off for my trade-in okay I understand that so let me ask you this if you owed nothing on your trade would it be okay if I gave you nothing no I just want what it's worth right okay so you know like I said before if it was worth nothing you wouldn't want nothing so I'm gonna do today I'm gonna give you what it's worth which is what you owe and what it's worth or a future for there's a different case that's it good job it was a pretty simple stall you didn't get caught up in it there was no well if I can get you payoff for my for your training would you buy it today no oh give it away money oh but that happens okay yeah so wherever you are right now okay I want you to watch what you say watch what Levi says and guess what there may be a hundred right answers to each one of these okay but this is just another tool and the main goal is this is roleplay time yeah this right here helps you get sharp so it costs him no money in here to mess up but it costs the money's wings out a lot he's back last one and this is one I think a lot of people have to have struggle with and it's real easy but I'm gonna tell Levi I just walk up to the dealership and I say I'm just looking around okay perfect man that's actually great for me takes a lot of stress off me because you're just looking around he's out meet Selma um so what that mean we'll just treat this thing like Dave will walk around look at the vehicles that we have you find something you like maybe you get married maybe you don't but either way it makes this whole thing a lot easier for something to stress out about that's it he basically said hey bottom line is you're looking around and takes all the stress off me right I means I don't have to be forced to sell something there you know nobody has any pressure let's look around it's kind of like dating you find a car you fall in love with maybe marry it maybe you don't well whatever it is let's not stress out about okay by the way again my name's leave I'm here to help you let's go out here look for vehicle suite that's it why because I'm just looking around is made to get you stuck because they know that salesmen hate hearing that word yeah I'm just looking around and most people say one of two things when I say I'm just looking around they say okay well I'm gonna be over there on the bend and you just wave to me when you find something I do and that's the the lazy guy and then you got the other guy who says hey you know I'm just looking around that salesman goes well you're just looking around the last words but you never found a cellphone to me right now you found me I'm gonna sell you you know I'm saying yeah and they're like oh they would say that's an arrogant prick we were talking about the car we didn't want to find exactly no he said hey you're just looking around cool man takes all the stress off both of us that means I don't have to sell something today if you find something I get to sell it cool but there's no pressure on either one of us that right there kills that I'm just looking around it puts it to bed and then we move forward so guys I hope this little roleplay session helped you these were ten objections with my man Levi and how much learn is you end up finishing and what was it February February I think right now I'm at like 15 grand on Commission before bonuses so I should be able to sixteen seventeen we'll see good job man yeah for a 19 year old it's pretty good take that alright guys have an amazing day keep up the training this is the kind of money that you can make when you train it's not complicated but you have to commit you pay the price in advance we're training yes and then the money comes okay so have a very blessed day I'm thankful to have Levi with us and have a great day yeah so yes
